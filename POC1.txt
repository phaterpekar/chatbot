Young Elizabeth : [standing at the bow of a ship and singing] ?We pillage, we plunder, we rifle and loot. Drink up me 'earties yo ho! We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot. Drink up me 'earties yo ho! Yo ho, yo ho a pirate's life for me. We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack. Drink up ? [Gibbs puts his hand on her shoulder which surprises her]

Gibbs : Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these waters. You don?t want to bring them down on us, now, do ya?

Norrington: Mr. Gibbs , that will do!

Gibbs : She was singing about pirates. Bad luck to be singing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog. Mark my words.

Norrington: Consider them marked. On your way.

Gibbs : Aye, Lieutenant. It's bad luck to have a woman on board, too? even a miniature one.

Young Elizabeth : I think it?d be rather exciting to meet a pirate.

Norrington: Think again, Miss Swann . Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag or wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves ? a short drop and a sudden stop. [ Elizabeth glances at Gibbs who mimes a hanging]

Governor Swann : Lieutenant Norrington , I appreciate your fervor, but I?m, uh, I?m concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter.

Norrington: My apologies, Governor Swann .

Young Elizabeth : Actually, I find it all fascinating.

Governor Swann : Yes. That's what concerns me.

Young Elizabeth : [sees a parasol and then a piece of wreckage with a boy on it in the water] Look! A boy! There's a boy in the water!

Norrington: Man overboard! Man the ropes. Fetch a Hook! Haul him aboard. [they get him on board] He's still breathing.

Gibbs : [spots burning ship] Mary , Mother of God!

Governor Swann : What happened here?

Norrington: It's most likely the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

Gibbs : A lot of good it did them. Everyone's thinking it. I'm just saying it. Pirates.

Governor Swann : There's no proof of that. It was probably an accident.

Norrington: Rouse the Captain immediately! Heave to and take in sail. Launch the boats.

Sailor: Heave to!

Governor Swann : Elizabeth , I want you to accompany the boy. He?ll be in your charge. Take care of him. [she nods and walks over to the young Will ]

Young Elizabeth : [Will awakes, grabbing her wrist] It?s ok. My name?s Elizabeth Swann .

Young Will: W-W-Will Turner .

Young Elizabeth : I'm watching over you, Will . [ Will faints, she notices medallion and examines it] You're a p-pirate. [hides it when Norrington approaches]

Norrington: Has he said anything?

Young Elizabeth : His name is William Turner . That's all I found out.

Norrington: [to sailors] Take him below.

[ Elizabeth studies the medallion closer and upon looking up sees a ship with the black flag flying at its mast; she closes her eyes]

[End dream]

Scene 2: (A beautiful dress and an impressive sword)

[ Elizabeth awakes and decides to take out the medallion from a hiding place in her bureau drawer; she puts it on; there's a knock on the door]

Governor Swann : Elizabeth ? Are you alright? Are you decent?

Elizabeth : [hides medallion in the bodice of her nightgown, throws on a robe] Yes, yes!

Governor Swann : Still abed at this hour? [opens the curtains and the window] It?s a beautiful day. I have a gift for you. [reveals dress]

Elizabeth : Oh, it?s beautiful!

Governor Swann : Isn?t it?

Elizabeth : May I inquire as to the occasion?

Governor Swann : Does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter? [to the maids] Go on. Actually, I, um?I had hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today.

Elizabeth : The ceremony?

Governor Swann : Captain Norrington ?s promotion ceremony.

Elizabeth : I knew it!

Governor Swann : Commodore Norrington, as he?s about to become! [the maids lace Elizabeth up into a corset] A fine gentleman, don?t you think? He fancies you, you know. Elizabeth? How?s it coming?

Elizabeth : It?s difficult to say.

Governor Swann : I?m told it?s the latest fashion in London

Elizabeth : Well, women in London must?ve learned not to breathe.

Servant: Milord, you have a visitor.

[ Will studies a sconce and upon touching it, a piece comes off in his hand; he buries it in the vase that?s holding canes and umbrellas]

Governor Swann : [walks downstairs after the servant] Ah, Mr. Turner , good to see you again.

Will: Good day, sir. I have your order. [opens case and takes out the sword]

Governor Swann : [takes the sword and unsheathes it] Well.

Will : The blade is folded steel. That?s gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may. [balances the sword] Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly the full width of the blade. [flips the sword and presents it gracefully to the Governor]

Governor Swann : [takes the sword] Impressive. Very impressive. Ah, now, Commodore Norrington is going to be very pleased with this. Do pass my compliments on to your Master. Hmm?

Will : I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated.

Governor Swann : [enter Elizabeth ] Oh, Elizabeth , you look absolutely stunning.

Elizabeth : Will! It?s so good to see you. I had a dream about you last night.

Will : About me?

Governor Swann : Yes, well, is that entirely proper for you to??

Elizabeth : About the day we met, do you remember?

Will : How could I forget, Miss Swann ?

Elizabeth : Will, how many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth ?

Will: At least once more, Miss Swann , as always.

Governor Swann : There. See? At least the boy has a sense of propriety. Now, we really must be going. [gives Elizabeth a parasol] There you are.

Elizabeth : Good day, Mr. Turner .

Governor Swann : Come along.

Will: Good day? [Elizabeth and the Governor exit, Will trailing after them, they leave in a carriage] ? Elizabeth .

(We hear the soundtrack The Medallion Calls)

Scene 3: (A most excellent entrance, the debate, and the proposal)

[Jack stands on the mast of his boat, noticing that it?s filling up with water he jumps down to bail it out; notices three pirate skeletons hanging with a sign ?pirates ye be warned? and pays homage to them; reaches the port, his boat sinking lower and lower until he is at the dock and is able to simply walk off the boat?s mast]

Harbormaster: [to Jack ] What ? hey. Hold up, there, you. It?s a shilling to tie up your boat at the dock. [they both look at the sunken boat] And I shall need to know your name.

Jack : [hands him three shillings] What d?ye say to three shillings? and we forget the name?

Harbormaster: Welcome to Port Royal , Mr. Smith . [ Jack sees the Harbormasters money pouch and takes it]

[Norrington?s promotion ceremony] Shouted orders to soldiers: Two paces march! Right about face! Present arms! [Norrington walks to get his promotion, unsheathes his new sword]

Murtogg: [spots Jack ] This dock is off limits to civilians.

Jack : I?m terribly sorry. I didn?t know. If I see one, I shall inform you immediately. [tries to continue on his way but is again thwarted] Apparently there?s some sort of high toned and fancy to do up at the fort, eh? How could it be that two upstanding gentlemen such as yourselves did not merit an invitation?

Murtogg: Someone has to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians.

Jack : It?s a fine goal - to be sure - but it seems to me that a? [shifts again] a ship like that [points out the Dauntless] makes this one here a bit superfluous, really.

Murtogg: Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough, but there?s no ship as can match the Interceptor for speed.

Jack : I?ve heard of one, supposed to be very fast ? nigh un-catchable?... the Black Pearl.

Mullroy: Well?there?s no real ship as can match the Interceptor.

Murtogg: The Black Pearl is a real ship.

Mullroy: No, no it?s not.

Murtogg: Yes, it is, I?ve seen it.

Mullroy: You?ve seen it?

Murtogg: Yes.

Mullroy: You haven?t seen it.

Murtogg: Yes, I have.

Mullroy: You?ve seen a ship with black sails, that?s crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out?

Murtogg: No.

Mullroy: No.

Murtogg: But I have seen a ship with black sails. [ Jack slips away while they banter]

Mullroy: Oh, and no ship that?s not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails therefore couldn?t possibly be any other ship than the Black Pearl. Is that what you?re saying?

Murtogg: [nods] No.

Mullroy: Like I said, there?s no real ship as can match the Interceptor? - [notices Jack at the wheel of the Interceptor]

Murtogg: Hey! You! Get away from there.

Mullroy: You don?t have permission to be aboard there, mate.

Jack : I?m sorry, it?s just - it?s such a pretty boat. Ship.

Murtogg: What?s your name?

Jack : Smith. Or Smithy, if you like.

Mullroy: What?s your purpose in Port Royal , Mr. Smith ?

Murtogg: Yeah. and no lies!

Jack: Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out!

Murtogg: I said no lies!

Mullroy: I think he?s telling the truth.

Murtogg: If he were telling the truth, he wouldn?t have told us.

Jack : Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn?t believe the truth even if he told it to you.

[on the battlements of the Fort] Norrington: May I have a moment? [Elizabeth and Norrington step onto the platform. Elizabeth walks over to steady herself as she fans herself hastily and tries to catch her breath] Uh, you look lovely, Elizabeth. [Elizabeth still fanning herself chuckles softly and half-heartedly] I, uh, apologize if I seem forward, but I? must speak my mind. This promotion throws into sharp relief that which I have not yet achieved. Uh? a marriage to a fine woman. You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.

Elizabeth : I can?t breathe.

Norrington: Yes, I? I?m a bit nervous myself. [she falls over battlement]

Scene 4: (The daring rescue and escape)

Jack : [in boat with guards] ?and then they made me their chief.

Norrington: Elizabeth ? Elizabeth ! My God.[makes to jump in after her]

Gillette : [stops him] The rocks! Sir, it?s a miracle she missed them.

Jack : Will you be saving her then?

Mullroy: I can?t swim.

Jack : [glances at Murtogg who stares back at him] Pride of the King?s Navy you are. [hands the guards his effects] Do not lose these. [dives in to save her]

Murtogg: [the medallion calls to the Black Pearl ] What was that? [helps Jack with Elizabeth ] Ooh, I got her. She?s not breathing!

Jack : Move! [shoves him aside, cuts open corset and Elizabeth spits out water and gasps for breath]

Mullroy: Never would?ve thought of that.

Jack : Clearly you?ve never been to Singapore . [sees medallion, to Elizabeth ] Where did you get that?

Norrington: [to Jack , pointing his sword at him] On your feet.

Governor Swann : [helps Elizabeth up] Elizabeth . Are you alright?

Elizabeth : Yes, I?m fine.

Governor Swann : [sees Murtogg holding Elizabeth 's corset; Murtogg points at Jack ; Swann looks over at Jack ] Shoot him!

Elizabeth : Father! Commodore, do you really intend to kill my rescuer?

Norrington: I believe thanks are in order. [offers his hand to shake; reveals ?P? for pirate] Had a brush with the East India Trading company, did we, pirate?

Governor Swann : Hang him.

Norrington: Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette , fetch some irons. [sees tattoo of a sparrow in flight] Well, well? Jack Sparrow , isn?t it?

Jack : Captain Jack Sparrow , if you please, sir.

Norrington: Well, I don?t see your ship?Captain.

Jack : I?m in the market as it were.

Murtogg: He said he?d come to commandeer one.

Mullroy: Told ya he was telling the truth. These are his, sir. [hands him Jack ?s effects]

Norrington: No additional shots nor powder. A compass that doesn?t point north. [unsheathes sword] And I half expected it to be made of wood. You are without doubt the worst pirate I?ve ever heard of.

Jack : But you have heard of me. [is pulled along to be put in chains]

Elizabeth : Commodore, I really must protest.

Norrington: Carefully, Lieutenant.

Elizabeth : Pirate or not this man saved my life.

Norrington: One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.

Jack : Though it seems enough to condemn him.

Norrington: Indeed. [ Gillette moves away from Jack ]

Jack : Finally. [throws his irons around Elizabeth ?s neck]

Governor Swann : No, don?t shoot!

Jack : I knew you?d warm up to me. Commodore Norrington, my effects, please, and my hat. Commodore! Elizabeth . It is Elizabeth isn?t it?

Elizabeth : It?s Miss Swann .

Jack : Miss Swann , if you?d be so kind. Come, come, dear. We don?t have all day. Now if you?d be very kind. [she straps on his sword, puts on his hat, etc.] Easy on the goods, darling.

Elizabeth : You?re despicable.

Jack : Sticks and stones, love. I saved your life, you save mine, we?re square. Gentlemen, m?lady, you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow ! [pushes Elizabeth away and escapes, swinging around and landing on a beam above their heads]

Governor Swann : Now, will you shoot him?

Norrington: Open fire! [ Jack is shot at] On his heels. [ Jack throws his chains about a rope and slides down to the ground] Gillette , Mr. Sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows. I would hate for him to miss it.

Soldier: [the soldiers run around searching for Jack ] Search upstairs. Look lively, men.

Scene 5: (The duel between Jack and Will )

Jack : [enters smithy, sees drunk and sleeping Mr. Brown and pokes him to see if he?ll awaken] Whoa! [tries to get rid of the irons with a hammer but it doesn?t work; uses the red hot end of a metal rod to spur the donkey; succeeds in breaking the link between them by putting them on two turning wheels in the machinery powered by the donkey; hides when Will enters]

Will : [calms the donkey; sees Brown ] Right where I left you. [sees hammer] Not where I left you. [notices Jack ?s hat and reaches for it; enter Jack with sword unsheathed] You're the one they're hunting. The pirate.

Jack : You seem somewhat familiar. Have I threatened you before?

Will : I make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.

Jack : Ah, well, then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So, if you'll excuse me? [turns away and is about to leave when Will gets his own sword] Do you think this wise, boy ? crossing blades with a pirate?

Will : You threatened Miss Swann .

Jack : Only a little. [they parry] You know what you?re doing. I?ll give you that. Excellent form. But how?s your footwork? If I step here; [he steps] very good. Now I step again. Ta. [sheathes sword and walks to the door; Will throws sword which gets stuck in the door, barring the exit; Jack tries to pull it out but is unsuccessful] That is a wonderful trick? except, once again you are between me and my way out. And now you have no weapon. [ Will takes out a sword with a heated tip; they fight] Who makes all these? [looks pointedly at swords]

Will : I do! And I practice with them? three hours a day!

Jack : You need to find yourself a girl, mate! Or perhaps the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet. You're not a eunuch, are you? [looks down]

Will : I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate, I can kill it! [they continue their swordfight jumping onto a cart that sways under them; Will hooks a knife in the irons hanging from Jack?s left wrist and throws it up so it is embedded in the beam above, in return Jack hits a loose board which throws Will off the cart; Jack uses his body weight to get the knife out of the wood and falls back on the cart just as Will climbed back on; Will is thrown up into the rafters and cuts free a heavy sack which vaults Jack up into the rafters as well; they fight, jumping from beam to beam; Jack loses his weapon and blinds Will with sand; takes out his pistol while Will protects his eyes] You cheated!

Jack : Pirate! [hears men trying to break the door down] Move away.

Will: No.

Jack : Please move.

Will: No! I cannot just step aside and let you escape.

Jack : (cocks his weapon) This shot is not meant for you. [gets hit on the head with a bottle of alcohol and falls unconscious]

Soldier: [Norrington?s men break in the door] There he is. Over here.

Norrington: Excellent work, Mr. Brown . You?ve assisted in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.

Mr. Brown : Just doing my civic duty, sir.

Norrington: Well, I trust you will always remember this as the day that Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped. Take him away.

Scene 6: (Talk of the right match and Port Royal under attack!)

Prisoners: [whistling and waving a bone to a dog that has the keys to the prison in its jaws] Come here, boy. Want a nice juicy bone? Come here. Come on

Jack : You can keep doing that forever, the dog is never going to move.

Prisoner: Oh, excuse us if we haven't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet.

[in the Governor?s house; Elisabeth ?s room] Estrella: There you go, Miss. [puts a bed warmer between the sheets] It was a difficult day for you, I?m sure.

Elizabeth : I suspected Commodore Norrington would propose but I must admit, I wasn?t entirely prepared for it.

Estrella: Well, I meant you being threatened by that pirate. Sounds terrifying.

Elizabeth : Oh, yes, it was terrifying.

Estrella: But the Commodore proposed. Fancy that. Now, that?s a smart match, Miss, if it?s not too bold to say.

Elizabeth : It is a smart match. He?s a fine man; he?s what any woman should dream of marrying.

Estrella: Well, that Will Turner , he?s a fine man, too.

Elizabeth : That is too bold.

Estrella: Well, begging your pardon, Miss. It was not my place. [leaves]

[meanwhile Will is hammering a new sword, he looks out unto the deserted street]

[on top of the Fort] Governor Swann : Has my daughter given you an answer yet?

Norrington: No, she hasn?t.

Governor Swann : Well, she has had a very trying day. Ghastly weather, don?t you think?

Norrington: Bleak. Very bleak.

Governor Swann : What?s that?

Norrington: Cannon fire! [tackles the Governor] Return fire!

[in the jail] Jack : I know those guns. [looks out of his little window] It?s the Pearl .

Prisoner: The Black Pearl ? I?ve heard stories. She?s been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years. Never leaves any survivors.

Jack : No survivors? Then where do the stories come from, I wonder?

[the Black Pearl?s guns are destroying the battlements, the pirates are now coming ashore in boats; Will takes up a sword, a hatchet, and a knife to fight the invading pirates; on the battlements;saves a maid by killing a pirate with his hatchet]

Norrington: [shouting orders to soldiers] Sight the muzzle flash!
Soldier: Aim for the flashes!

Norrington: I need a full strike, fore and aft! Let these demons both bite at this! [cannons are shot in the Black Pearl ?s direction] Governor, barricade yourself in my office. That?s an order!

[the Governor?s house; pirates are running through the gates an knocking on the door] Elizabeth : [to butler] Don?t! [the butler opens the door]
Pintel: Hello, chum. [shoots butler and the pirates swarm into the house] Up there! [points at Elizabeth ]

Pirate: Girl! [ Elizabeth runs upstairs]

Estrella: [they lock the chamber door] Miss Swann , they?ve come to kidnap you.

Elizabeth : What?

Estrella: You?re the Governor?s daughter.

Elizabeth : They haven?t seen you. Hide, and the first chance you get, run to the fort. [distracts Ragetti and Pintel as the maid runs out, hits Pintel in the face with the bed warmer]

Ragetti: Gotcha! [catches Elizabeth and she releases ashes onto his head] It?s hot! You burned me!

Pintel: [to Ragetti] Come on! [Estrella escapes; Elizabeth is cornered on the stairs and while pirates are distracted by one of their own being taken out by a cannon she runs away; Pintel and Ragetti are stopped by a falling chandelier and Elizabeth locks the door and then tries to get a sword out but is unable; Pintel and Ragetti break the door] We know you?re here, Poppet.

Ragetti: Poppet.

Pintel: Come out? and we promise we won?t hurt you. [Ragetti looks at Pintel questioningly who only smiles] We will find you, Poppet. You?ve got something of ours, and it calls to us. The gold calls to us.

Ragetti: Gold calls?

Pintel: [opens door of the closet] ?Ello, Poppet.

Elizabeth : Parley!

Ragetti: What?

Elizabeth : Parley. I invoke the right of parley. According to the Code of the brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew , you have to take me to your Captain.

Pintel: I know the code.

Elizabeth : If an adversary demands parley you can do them no harm until the parley is complete.

Ragetti: To blazes with the code.

Pintel: She wants to be taken to the Captain. And she?ll go without a fuss. We must honor the Code.

[ Port Royal street ; Will is fighting with Grapple] Grapple: [to Will , holding him defenseless] Say goodbye! [signs falls on him]

Will: Goodbye.

Pintel: [to Elizabeth , leading her to the Black Pearl ] Come on!

Elizabeth : Will.

Will : [spots them] Elizabeth . [sees the same pirate he killed with his hatchet and is confused]

Pirate: Outta my way, scum. [knocks Will on the head, he faints]

Scene 7: (No luck and on board the Black Pearl )

[in jail] Prisoner: [a hole is blown in a cell, to Jack ] My sympathies, friend, you?ve no manner of luck at all.

Jack: [picks up the bone and whistles] Come on, doggy. It?s just you and me now. It?s you and ol? Jack . Come on. Come on, good boy. That a good boy, come on! Bit closer, bit closer. That?s it, that?s it, doggy. Come on you filthy, slimy, mangy cur. [there?s a crash downstairs and the dog runs away] No, no, no, no, no, I didn?t mean it. I didn?t... [a crash as the prison guard is thrown down the stairs]

Twigg: [looks a round] This ain?t the armory.

Koehler: Well, well, well, look what we have here Twigg ? Captain Jack Sparrow .

Twigg: [spits] Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a godforsaken island, shrinking into the distance. His fortunes aren?t improved much.

Jack : Worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen. The deepest circle of Hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers. [Koehler grabs Jack ?s throat; Jack sees skeletal arm] So there is a curse. That?s interesting.

Koehler: You know nothing of Hell. [they leave]

Jack : That?s very interesting.

[ Elizabeth is rowed across with the pirates; on board the Black Pearl ] Bo?sun : I didn?t know we was takin? on captives.

Pintel: She?s invoked the right of parley with Captain Barbossa .

Elizabeth : I am here to negotiate ? [is backhanded by Bo?sun ]

Bo?sun : You will speak when spoken to.

Barbossa: [grabs Bo?sun ?s wrist] And ye not lay a hand on those under the protection of parley.

Bo?sun : Aye, sir.

Barbossa: My apologies, Miss.

Elizabeth : Captain Barbossa , I am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal .

Barbossa: There are a lot of long words in there, Miss; we?re naught but humble pirates. What is it that you want?

Elizabeth : I want you to leave and never come back.

Barbossa: I?m disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means ?no.?

Elizabeth : Very well. I?ll drop it. [dangles medallion over the sea]

Barbossa: Me holds are burstin' with swag. That bit of shine matters to us? Why?

Elizabeth : It?s what you?ve been searching for. I recognized the ship. I saw it eight years ago on the crossing from England .

Barbossa: Did ya, now?

Elizabeth : Fine. Well, I suppose if it is worthless then there?s no point in me keeping it. [it drops a bit, the pirates lunge forward]

Barbossa: Ah. [chuckles] You have a name, Missy?

Elizabeth : Elizabeth ?Turner. I?m a maid in the Governor?s household. [she curtsies]

Barbossa: Miss Turner ??

Pintel: Bootstrap.

Barbossa: And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that. Family heirloom, perhaps?

Elizabeth : I didn?t steal it, if that?s what you mean.

Barbossa: Very well, you hand it over and we?ll put your town to our rudder and ne?er return.

Elizabeth : [she hands it over] Our bargain? [Barbossa walks away from her]

Bo?sun : Still the guns and stow ?em, Signal the men, set the flags and make good to clear port.

Elizabeth : Wait! You have to take me to shore. According to the Code of the Order of the Brethren -

Barbossa: First, your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement so I must do nothing. And secondly, you must be a pirate for the pirate?s code to apply and you?re not. And thirdly, the code is more what you'd call "guidelines" than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl , Miss Turner .

Scene 8: (To save Elizabeth and Jack ?s rescue)

Will : [awakes on the street in the morning; to Norrington] They?ve taken her. They?ve taken Elizabeth .

Norrington: Mr. Murtogg , remove this man.

Will : We have to hunt them down. we must save her.

Governor Swann : And where do you propose we start? If you have any information concerning my daughter, please share it.

Murtogg: That Jack Sparrow . He talked about the Black Pearl.

Mullroy: Mentioned it, is more what he did.

Will : Ask him where it is. Make a deal with him. He could lead us to it.

Norrington: No?the pirates who invaded this Fort left Sparrow locked in his cell ergo they are not his allies. Governor, we will establish their most likely course?

Will : [buries hatchet in the table] That?s not good enough!

Norrington: Mr. Turner , you are not a military man, you are not a sailor. You are a blacksmith and this is not the moment for rash actions. (whispers to Will) Do NOT make the mistake of thinking you are the ONLY man here who cares for Elizabeth . [hands him back his hatchet]

[in jail] Jack : [trying to pick the lock with a bone] Please.... [hears footsteps, leaves the bone in the lock and lies down]

Will: You. Sparrow!

Jack : Aye.

Will : You are familiar with that ship ? the Black Pearl?

Jack : I?ve heard of it.

Will : Where does it make berth?

Jack : Where does it make berth? Have you not heard the stories? Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerta . It?s an island that cannot be found except by those who already know where it is.

Will : The ship?s real enough. Therefore its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?

Jack : [studies his nails] Why ask me?

Will : Because you?re a pirate.

Jack : And you want to turn pirate yourself, is that it?

Will : Never! (he relents) They took Miss Swann .

Jack : Oh, so it is that you?ve found a girl. I see. Well, if you?re intending to brave all, hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady?s heart you?ll have to do it alone, mate. I see no profit in it for me.

Will : I can get you out of here.

Jack : How?s that? The key?s run off.

Will : I helped build these cells. These are half pin-barrel hinges. [picks up a bench and places it at the bottom of the cell door] With the right leverage and the proper application of strength? the door will lift free.

Jack : What?s your name?

Will: Will Turner .

Jack : That will be short for William , I imagine. Good, strong name. No doubt, named for your father, eh?

Will: Yes.

Jack : Uh-huh. Well, Mr. Turner , I?ve changed me mind. If you spring me from this cell I swear on pain of death I shall take you to the Black Pearl and your bonny lass. Do we have an accord?

Will : [they shake hands] Agreed.

Jack : Agreed. Get me out.

Will : [lifts the door free] Hurry. Someone will have heard that.

Jack : Not without my effects.

Scene 9: (Commandeering a ship)

Will : We?re going to steal the ship. That ship? [glances at the Dauntless]

Jack : Commandeer. We?re going to commandeer that ship. Nautical term. One question about your business, boy, or there?s no use going. This girl ? how far are you willing to go to save her?

Will : I?d die for her.

Jack : Oh, good. No worries, then.

Will : [under boat underwater with Jack in the lead] This is either madness or brilliance.

Jack : It?s remarkable how often those two traits coincide. [they board the Dauntless] Everyone stay calm! we are taking over the ship.

Will: Aye! Avast! [the men laugh]

Gillette : This ship cannot be crewed by two men. You?ll never make it out of the bay.

Jack : [points his pistol at Gillette ?s nose] Son?I?m Captain Jack Sparrow. Savvy?

Groves : [notices Gillette and his men a small boat] Commodore!

Gillette : [waving and screaming from the boat] Sir, they?ve taken the Dauntless. They?ve taken the ship. Sparrow and Turner - they?ve taken the Dauntless.

Norrington: [sees the two on board the ship through his spy glass] Rash, Turner, too rash. That is without doubt the worst pirate I have ever seen.

Will : [notices the Interceptor set sail] Here they come.

Gillette : [to his crew about the boat] Bring her around! Bring her around!

Norrington: [he and his men board the Dauntless] Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges. [ Jack and Will swing onto the Interceptor and sail away; Norrington notices] Sailors, back to the Interceptor! Now!

Sailor: Quickly men! [they try but are too late]

Jack : Thank you, Commodore, for getting us ready to make way. We?d have had a hard time of it by ourselves.

Norrington: Set top sails and clear up this mess.

Groves : With the wind at quarter astern, we won?t catch them.

Norrington: We don?t need to catch them just get them in range of the long nines.

Groves : Hands, come about. Run out the guns. [to Norrington] We open fire on our own ship, sir?

Norrington: I?d rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

Sailor: Commodore, he?s disabled the rudder chain, sir!

Gillette : [the Interceptor bears down on his boat] Abandon ship! [they jump off just in time as the boat is broken up and sinks under the Interceptor]

Groves : That?s got to be the best pirate I?ve ever seen.

Norrington: So it would seem.

Scene 10: (Revelations and Tortuga )

Will : [sharpening his sword] When I was a lad living in England , my mother raised me by herself. After she died, I came out here, looking for my father.

Jack : Is that so?

Will: My father, Will Turner . At the jail, it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help. Since that?s what I wanted, I didn?t press the matter. I?m not a simpleton, Jack. You knew my father.

Jack : I knew ?im. Probably one the few who knew him as William Turner . Everyone else just called him Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.

Will: Bootstrap?

Jack : Good man. Good pirate. I swear you look just like him.

Will : It?s not true. He was a merchant sailor. A good, respectable man who obeyed the law.

Jack : He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

Will : My father was not a pirate. [takes out his sword]

Jack : Put it away, son. It?s not worth you getting beat again.

Will : You didn?t beat me. you ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I?d killed you.

Jack : Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, then, is it? [moves one of the sails so that the yard catches Will and swings him out over the sea] Now, as long as you?re just hanging there, pay attention. The only rules that really matter are these ? what a man can do and what a man can?t do. For instance, you can accept that your father was a pirate and a good man or you can?t. But pirate is in your blood, boy, so you?ll have to square with that someday. Now, me, for example, I can let you drown but I can?t bring this ship into Tortuga all by me onesy, savvy? So? [swings him back on board and offers him his sword] can you sail under the command of a pirate? Or can you not?

Will : [takes the sword] Tortuga ?

Jack : Tortuga . [on the island] More importantly, it is indeed a sad life that has never breathed deep this sweet, proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga , savvy? What do you think?

Will : It'll linger.

Jack : I?ll tell you mate, if every town in the world were like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted.

Jack : Scarlett ! [she slaps him] Not sure I deserved that. Giselle!

Giselle: Who was she?!

Jack : What? [she slaps him] I may have deserved that.

Scene 11: (A proposition)

Gibbs : [ Jack throws a bucket of water at him] Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot! Mother?s love! Jack ! You should know better than to wake a man when he?s sleeping. ?S bad luck.

Jack : Ah, fortunately I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys, the man who was sleeping, a drink. The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking.

Gibbs : Aye, that'll about do it. [ Will throws another bucket of water at him] Blast! I?m already awake!

Will : That was for the smell.

Jack : [they enter a tavern; to Will ] Keep a sharp eye. [sits at a table with Gibbs ]

Gibbs : Now, what?s the nature of this venture of yourn?

Jack : I?m going after the Black Pearl. [ Gibbs almost chokes on his drink] I know where it?s going to be, and I?m going to take it.

Gibbs : Jack , it?s a fool?s errand. Why, you know better than me the tales of the Black Pearl.

Jack : That?s why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.

Gibbs : From what I hear tell of Captain Barbossa , he?s not a man to suffer fools, nor strike a bargain with one.

Jack : Well, then I?d say it?s a very good thing I?m not a fool then, eh?

Gibbs : Prove me wrong. What makes ye think Barbossa will give up his ship to you?

Jack : Let?s just say it?s a matter of leverage, eh? [nods at Will ]

Gibbs : The kid?

Jack : That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His only child, savvy?

Gibbs : Is he, now?? Leverage,? says you. ?I think I feel a change in the wind,? says I. I?ll find us a crew. There?s bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you.

Jack : One can only hope. Take what you can? [toasts Gibbs ]

Gibbs : [they clink their tankards] ?Give nothing back. [drain their drinks]

Scene 12: (The origin of the curse)

Pintel: You'll be dinin' with the captain. And he requests you wear this. [gives her a dress]

Elizabeth : Well, you may tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.

Pintel: He said you?d say that. He also said if that be the case, you'll be dinin' with the crew?and you'll be naked. [she snatches the dress] Fine.

[in the Captain?s cabin, the food is laid out] Barbossa: [ Elizabeth eats daintily] There?s no need to stand on ceremony, nor call to impress anyone. You must be hungry. [gives her a goblet with wine] Try the wine. And the apples? [offers her one] One of those next.

Elizabeth : It?s poisoned.

Barbossa: There would be no sense to be killing ye, Miss Turner .

Elizabeth : Then release me, you have your trinket; I?m of no further value to you.

Barbossa: [takes out the medallion] You don?t know what this is, do ye?

Elizabeth : It?s a pirate medallion.

Barbossa: This is Aztec gold? one of 882 identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to Corts himself. Blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies. But the greed of Corts was insatiable. So the heathen gods placed upon the gold?a terrible curse. Any mortal that removes but a single piece from that stone chest shall be punished for eternity.

Elizabeth : I hardly believe in ghost stories anymore, Captain Barbossa .

Barbossa: Aye. That?s exactly what I thought when we were first told the tale. Buried on an Island of Dead what cannot be found except for those who know where it is. Find it, we did. There be the chest. Inside be the gold. And we took ?em all. We spent ?em and traded ?em and frittered ?em away on drink and food and pleasurable company. The more we gave ?em away, the more we came to realize?the drink would not satisfy, food turned to ash in our mouths, and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust. We are cursed men, Miss Turner . Compelled by greed, we were, but now we are consumed by it. [ Elizabeth takes a butter knife and hides it] There is one way we can end our curse. All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold must be restored and the blood repaid. Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.

Elizabeth : And the blood to be repaid?

Barbossa: That?s why there?s no sense to be killin? ye?yet. [offers her an apple] Apple? Arr. [she stabs him with the knife; he takes it out] I?m curious ? after killin? me what was it you plannin? on doing next? [she runs out and sees the pirates, all decaying skeletons] Look! The moonlight shows us for what we really are. We are not among the living, and so we cannot die, but neither are we dead. For too long I?ve been parched with thirst and unable to quench it. Too long I?ve been starving to death and haven?t died. I feel nothing ? not the wind on my face nor the spray of the sea, nor the warmth of a woman?s flesh. [walks out into the moonlight and reveals a skeleton] You best start believing in ghost stories Miss Turner . You?re in one! [drinks and it pours over his ribs, laughs and the crew laughs with him] What are ye looking at? Back to work!

Pirates: You heard the Captain. Back to work.

Scene 13: ( Jack ?s crew)

Gibbs : Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them, faithful hands before the mast, every man worth his salt. And crazy to boot.

Will : So this is your able-bodied crew?

Jack : You, sailor!

Gibbs : Cotton, sir.

Jack : Mr. Cotton ? do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death? Mr. Cotton ! Answer, man!

Gibbs : He's a mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so he trained the parrot to talk for him. No one?s yet figured how.

Jack : Mr. Cotton 's... parrot. Same question.

Parrot: Wind in the sails! Wind in the sails!

Gibbs : Mostly, we figure, that means ?yes.'?

Jack : O?course it does. [to Will ] Satisfied?

Will : Well, you?ve proved they?re mad.

Anamaria: And what?s the benefit for us?

Jack : [comes over to the voice and takes off the sailors hat, revealing a woman] Anamaria. [she slaps him]

Will : I suppose you didn?t deserve that one either.

Jack : No, that one I deserved.

Anamaria: You stole my boat!

Jack : Actually - [she slaps him again] borrowed. Borrowed without permission. But with every intention of bringing it back to you.

Anamaria: But you didn?t!

Jack : You?ll get another one.

Anamaria: [points her forefinger at him] I will.

Will: A better one.

Jack : A better one!

Will: That one. [points to the Interceptor]

Jack : What one? That one?! Aye, that one. What say you?

Crew: Aye!

Cotton?s Parrot: Anchors aweigh.

Gibbs : No, no, no, no, no, it?s frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard, sir.

Jack : It?d be far worse not to have her.

[a storm breaks upon them at sea] Will : How can we sail to an island that nobody can find with a compass that doesn?t work?

Gibbs : Aye, the compass doesn?t point north but we?re not trying to find north, are we? [to Jack ] We should drop canvas, sir.

Jack : She can hold a bit longer.

Gibbs : What?s in your head that?s put you in such a fine mood, Captain?

Jack : We?re catching up.

Scene 14: ( Jack ?s past revealed)

[on the Pearl ] Pintel: Time to go, Poppet. [Barbossa latches the medallion around Elizabeth ?s neck and they all sail to the cave]

Parrot: [singing as they enter a lagoon] Dead men tell no tales.

Gibbs : [the whole crew is looking at the wrecks strewn everywhere in the water] Puts a chill in the bones how many honest sailors have been claimed by this passage.

Will : [watches as Jack closes the compass when Cotton stares at him too much] How is it that Jack came by that compass?

Gibbs : Not a lot?s known about Jack Sparrow before he showed up in Tortuga with a mind to go after the treasure of the Isla de Muerta . That was before I met him, back when he was Captain of the Black Pearl.

Will: What? He failed to mention that.

Gibbs : Well, he plays things closer to the vest now. And a hard-learned lesson it was. See three days out on the venture the first mate comes to him and says everything?s an equal share. That should mean the location of the treasure, too, so Jack gives up the bearings. That night there was a mutiny. They marooned Jack on an island and left him to die but not before he?d gone mad with the heat.

Will : Ah. So that's the reason for all the? [acts like Jack ]

Gibbs : Reason's got nothing to do with it. Now Will , when a man is marooned he is a given a pistol with a single shot ? one shot. Well it won't do much good hunting or to be rescued. But after three weeks of a starvin? belly and thirst, that pistol will start to look real friendly. But Jack ? he escaped the island, and he still has that one shot. Oh, but he won't use it, though, save for one man. His mutinous first mate.

Will: Barbossa.

Gibbs : Aye.

Will : How did Jack get off the island?

Gibbs : Well, I?ll tell ye. He waded out into the shallows and there he waited three days and three nights till all manner of sea creature ?came and acclimated to his presence. And on the fourth morning, he roped himself a couple of sea turtles, lashed ?em together and made a raft.

Will : He roped a couple of sea turtles?

Gibbs : Aye, sea turtles.

Will : What did he use for rope?

Jack : [ Jack comes up] Human hair?from my back. Let go of the anchor!

Crew: Let go of the anchor, sir!

Jack : Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

Gibbs : Captain! What if the worst should happen?

Jack : Keep to the code.

Gibbs : Aye, the code.

Scene 15: (The blood ritual and Jack ?s not dead)

Pintel: Ten years of hoarding swag.

Ragetti: And now we finally get to spend it. [they empty a trunk and it turns out to be full of ladies? clothes; they both pick up parasols]

Pintel: Once we?re quit of the curse, we?ll be rich men. And you can buy an eye what actually fits and is made of glass.

Ragetti: This one does splinter something terrible. [rubs it]

Pintel: Stop rubbing it. [ Bo?sun walks by and rolls his eyes at them]

[in the boat] Will : [sees a skull] What Code is Gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen?

Jack : Pirate?s Code. Any man that falls behind?is left behind.

Will : No heroes amongst thieves, eh?

Jack : You know, for having such a bleak outlook on pirates you?re well on your way to becoming one. Sprung a man from jail, commandeered a ship of the Fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga [they both look at the gold on the bottom of the little river] ?and you?re completely obsessed with treasure.

Will : That?s not true. I am not obsessed with treasure.

Jack : [looks in on the gathering] Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.

Barbossa: Gentlemen, the time has come! Our salvation is nigh! Our torment is near at end.

Will: Elizabeth .

Barbossa: For ten years we?ve been tested and tried, and each man jack of you here has proved his mettle a hundred times over and a hundred times again! [the men cheer]

Ragetti: Suffered, I have.

Barbossa: Punished, we were. The lot of us - disproportionate to our crimes! Here it is [throws off the chest?s lid] ?the cursed treasure of Corts himself. Every last piece that went astray, we have returned?save for this. [points to the medallion on Elizabeth ?s neck]

Will : [scrambles up, upsetting some of the treasure] Jack !

Jack : [pulls him down] Not yet. We wait for the opportune moment.

Barbossa: 881 we found but despaired of ever finding the last.

Will : When?s that? When it?s of greatest profit to you?

Jack : May I ask you something? Have I ever given you reason not to trust me? Do us a favor ? I know it?s difficult for you, but please stay here and try not to do anything stupid.

Barbossa: And who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

Pirates: Us!

Barbossa: And whose blood must yet be paid?

Pirates: Hers!

Barbossa: You know the first thing I?m goin? to do after the curse is lifted? Eat a whole bushel of apples. [takes up the knife] Begun by blood?by blood undone.

Will : [hits Jack with oar] Sorry, Jack . I?m not going to be your leverage.

Elizabeth : [her palm is cut] That?s it?

Barbossa: Waste not. [drops the medallion; there is an anticipation to see if it worked]

Koehler: Did it work?

Ragetti: I don?t feel no different.

Pintel: How do we tell? [Barbossa shoots him]

Koehler: You?re not dead.

Pintel: No. He shot me!

Ragetti: It didn?t work.

Twigg: The curse it still upon us!

Barbossa: You, maid! Your father, what was his name? Was your father William Turner ?

Elizabeth : No.

Barbossa: Where?s his child? The child that sailed from England eight years ago, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner . Where? [backhands her and she falls down]

Bo?sun : You two! You brought us the wrong person!

Pintel: No! She had the medallion. she?s the proper age.

Ragetti: She said her name was Turner ? you heard her! [ Will motions for Elizabeth to follow him into the water; she takes the medallion with her] I think she lied to us.

Twigg: You brought us here for nothing.

Barbossa: I won?t take questioning and no second guesses, not from the likes of you, Master Twigg .

Koehler: Who?s to blame? Every decision you?ve made has led us from bad to worse.

Pirate: It was you who sent Bootstrap to the depths!

Bo?sun : And it?s you who brought us here in the first place.

Barbossa: If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak! Hmm?

Koehler: I say, we cut her throat and spill all her blood, just in case.

Barbossa: [sees the monkey pointing] The medallion! She?s taken it! Get after her! You feckless pack of ingrates!

Pirates: No oars here. Where?s the oars?

Bo?sun : The oars have gone missing. Find them!

Ragetti: [spots Jack ] You.

Pintel: You?re supposed to be dead!

Jack : Am I not? [looks down at himself] Oh. [finds pistols pointed at him] Palulay?palu-li-la-la-lulu, parlili? parsnip, pasley, par - partner, partner?

Ragetti: Parley?

Jack : Parley! That?s the one. Parley! Parley!

Pintel: Parley? Down to the depths whatever man that thought up ?parley!?

Jack : That would be the French.

Scene 16: (Keeping to the code, revealing the medallion, and talk of negotiation)

Elizabeth : [boards the Interceptor] Not more pirates.

Gibbs : Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth .

Elizabeth : Mr. Gibbs ?

Gibbs : [Will climbs aboard] Hey, boy, where be Jack ?

Elizabeth : Jack ? Jack Sparrow ?

Will : He fell behind. [leads Elizabeth away]

Gibbs : Keep to the code.

Anamaria: Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails! Make quickly, divvies.

[in the cave] Barbossa: How the blazes did you get off that island?

Jack : When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing, mate. I?m Captain Jack Sparrow .

Barbossa: Ah, well, I won?t be making that mistake again. Gents, you all remember Captain Jack Sparrow ? Kill him. [the pirates all point their weapons at Jack ]

Jack : The girl?s blood didn?t work, did it?

Barbossa: Hold your fire! [the pirates reluctantly lower their weapons] You know whose blood we need?

Jack : I know whose blood ye need.

[in the cabin of the Interceptor] Elizabeth : [trying to bandage her palm] What sort of a man trades a man?s life for a ship?

Will: Pirate. Here. Let me. [puts on bandages]

Elizabeth : Thank you.

Will : You said you gave Barbossa my name as yours. Why?

Elizabeth : I don?t know. [she winces and pulls away]

Will : I?m sorry. Blacksmith?s hands - I know they?re rough.

Elizabeth : No?I mean yes, they are but? but don?t stop.

Will: Elizabeth .

Elizabeth : [takes out medallion] It?s yours.

Will: I thought I?d lost it the day they rescued me. It was a gift from my father. He sent it to me. Why did you take it?

Elizabeth : Because I was afraid that you were a pirate. That would have been awful.

Will : It wasn?t your blood they needed. It was my father?s blood?my blood?the blood of a pirate.

Elizabeth : Will, I?m so sorry, please forgive me. [ Will slams down the medallion on the table and she leaves]

[in the Captains cabin of the Black Pearl ] Barbossa: So you expect to leave me standing on some beach with nothing but a name and your word it?s the one I need and watch you sail away in my ship?

Jack : No. I expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name at all, watching me sail away on my ship and then I?ll shout the name back to you. Savvy?

Barbossa: But that still leaves us with the problem of me standing on some beach with naught but a name and your word it?s the one I need.

Jack : Of the two of us, I am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny, therefore?my word is the one we'll be trusting. Although?I suppose I should be thanking you because, in fact, if you hadn?t betrayed me and left me to die, I would have an equal share in that curse, same as you. [bites into an apple] Funny ol' world, innit? [offers him an apple]

Bo?sun : [enters] Captain, we?re coming up on the Interceptor. [Barbossa goes topside]

Jack : [runs out after Barbossa and stands in front of him at the bow, blocking the view of the Interceptor] I?m having a thought here, Barbossa. What say we run up a flag of truce? I scurry over to the Interceptor, and I negotiate the return of your medallion, eh? What say you to that?

Barbossa: Now you see, Jack , that?s exactly the attitude that lost you the Pearl . People are easy to search when they?re dead. [to Bo?sun ] Lock him in the brig. [throws away Jack ?s apple]

Scene 17: (The chase and the fight)

Gibbs : Hands aloft to loose t'gallants! With this wind at her stern, she'll carry every sail we've got.

Elizabeth : [the crew is running around] What?s happening?

Anamaria: The Black Pearl, she?s gaining on us. [looks out at the Pearl ]

Elizabeth : This is the fastest ship in the Caribbean .

Anamaria: You can tell them that after they?ve caught us.

Elizabeth : We?re shallow on the draft, right?

Anamaria: Aye.

Elizabeth : Well, then can't we lose them amongst those shoals?

Gibbs : We don?t have to outrun them long, just long enough.

Anamaria: Lighten the ship, stem to stern!

Gibbs : Anything that we can afford to lose?see that it?s lost.

[on the Black Pearl ] Jack : [is locked in the brig by Bo?sun ; he sloshes in the water] Apparently there?s a leak.

Barbossa: Haul on the main brace! Make ready the guns! And run out the sweeps. [the gun ports are opened and the Jolly Roger is hoisted up]

[on the Interceptor, barrels are tossed over the side] Will : [looks out at the Black Pearl and sees the oars; stops a cannon from being thrown off] We?re gonna need that.

Anamaria: [sees the oars] It was a good plan?up ?till now.

Will: Gibbs ! We have to make a stand. We must fight! Load the guns!

Anamaria: With what?

Will: Anything. Everything! Anything we have left.

Gibbs : Load the guns! Take shot and langrage. Nails and crushed glass! With a will! [they stuff cutlery and other assorted items into the cannons including Gibbs ? canteen] The Pearl is going to luff up on our port quarter. She?ll rake us without ever presenting a target.

Elizabeth : Lower the anchor on the right side. On the starboard side!

Will : It certainly has the element of surprise.

Anamaria: You?re daft, lady! You both are!

Gibbs : Daft like Jack ! Lower the starboard anchor! Do it, ye dogs, or it?s you we?ll load into the cannons! [the anchor is lowered]

Elizabeth : [to Anamaria] Let go. [she lets go of the wheel and the ship swings about]

Barbossa: They're clubhaulin'! Hard to port! Rack the starboard oars.

Bo?sun : Hard to port! [the two ships come up side by side]

Will : Keep us steady now. Now!

Barbossa: Fire!

Elizabeth : Fire all! [the ships exchange cannon fire]

Jack : [a whole is blown in the hull] Stop blowing holes in my ship! [notices that the shot from the cannon destroyed the lock on the cell door]

Gibbs : We could use a few more ideas, lass.

Elizabeth : Your turn.

Gibbs : We need us a devil?s dowry.

Anamaria: We?ll give them her. [points her pistol at Elizabeth ]

Will : She?s not what they?re after.

Elizabeth : [notices that it?s not at her throat] The medallion. [ Will goes to search for it below]

Barbossa: Raise yer colors ya bloomin? cockroaches! Hands, grapnels, at the ready. Prepare to board! [Ragetti and Pintel fire a shot that severs the mast and it falls over; grapple hooks are thrown as pirates board the Interceptor] Blast all to carcasses, men! Forward clear to the powder magazine. And the rest of you, bring me the medallion! [pirates board the Interceptor]

Will : [is trapped when the mast falls] Hey! Hey! Below!

Jack : [emerges from the hold and takes a rope from a pirate] Thanks very much. [swings onto the Interceptor]

Gibbs : Jack !

Jack : [hands him canteen] Bloody empty. [helps Elizabeth ] That?s not very nice. Where?s the medallion?

Elizabeth : Wretch! [is about to slap him]

Jack : [catches her wrist] Ahh. Where?s dear William ?

Elizabeth : Will ? [sees him under a grate] Will!

Will: Elizabeth !

Jack : [sees monkey with medallion] Monkey! [runs after it]

Elizabeth : I can?t move it. [is dragged away] Will!

Will: Elizabeth !

Barbossa: [gets medallion from monkey] Why, thank you, Jack .

Jack : You?re welcome.

Barbossa: Not you. We named the monkey ? Jack .? Gents, our hope is restored! [the pirates ignite the powder leading to the collection of powder kegs while Will struggles to escape the cabin that is full of water]

Scene 18: (Misleading negotiations and walking the plank)

Pintel: [to Jack ?s crew] If any of you as much as thinks the word ?parley,? I?ll have your guts for garters.

Elizabeth : [the Interceptor is blown up] Will! [attacks Barbossa] You?ve got to stop it! Stop it!

Barbossa: Welcome back, Miss. You took advantage of our hospitality last time. It holds fair now that you return the favor. [pushes her to the crew]

Will : [leaps up on deck] Barbossa!

Elizabeth : Will.

Will : She goes free. [points pistol at Barbossa]

Barbossa: What?s in your head, boy?

Will : She goes free!

Barbossa: You?ve only got one shot, and we can?t die.

Jack : [to Will ] Don?t do anything stupid.

Will : You can?t. I can. [points gun at himself]

Jack : Like that.

Barbossa: Who are you?

Jack : [to Barbossa] No one. He?s no one. A distant cousin of my aunt?s nephew twice removed. Lovely singing voice, though ? eunuch.

Will : My name is Will Turner . My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins.

Ragetti: He?s the spitting image of ol? Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.

Will : On my word do as I say, or I?ll pull this trigger and be lost to Davy Jones? Locker.

Barbossa: Name your terms, Mr. Turner .

Will : Elizabeth goes free.

Barbossa: Yes, we know that one. Anything else?

Will : [sees Jack point at himself] And the crew ? the crew are not to be harmed.

Barbossa: Agreed.

Pintel: [to Elizabeth ] Go on, Poppet, go! Walk the plank!

Will: Barbossa, you lying bastard! You swore she?d go free!

Barbossa: Don?t dare impugn me honor, boy. I agreed she?d go free, but it was you who failed to specify when or where. [ Will ?s gagged] Though it does seem a shame to lose something so fine, don?t it lads?

Pirates: Aye.

Barbossa: So I?ll be having that dress back before you go.

Jack : [to pirate] I always liked you.

Elizabeth : It goes with your black heart. [throws him the dress]

Barbossa: [presses it to his face] Ooh, it?s still warm.

Pirate 2: Off you go! Come on!

Bo?sun : Too long! [shakes plank, Elizabeth falls in]

Jack : [is dragged up to the plank] I?d really rather hoped we were past all this.

Barbossa: Jack?. Jack . Did ya not notice? That be the same little island that we made you Governor of on our last little trip. [points out the distant island]

Jack : I did notice.

Barbossa: Perhaps you?ll be able to conjure up another miraculous escape?but I doubt it. [unsheathes his sword and brandishes it at Jack ?s throat] Off you go.

Jack : Last time, you left me a pistol with one shot.

Barbossa: By the powers, you?re right. Were be Jack ?s pistol? Bring it forward. [the pistol is brought]

Jack : Seeing as there?s two of us, a gentleman?would give us a pair of pistols.

Barbossa: It?ll be one pistol as before, and you can be the gentleman and shoot the lady and starve to death yourself. [throws the pistol into the sea, Jack jumps in after it and recovers it]

Scene 19: (Marooned again)

Jack : [looks back at the Pearl ; wades out onto the beach shaking off the ropes that bound his wrists] That?s the second time I?ve had to watch that man sail away with my ship.

Elizabeth : [follows Jack as he walks] But you were marooned on this island before, weren?t you? So we can escape in the same way you did then.

Jack : To what point and purpose, young missy? The Black Pearl is gone and unless you have a rudder and a lot of sails hidden in that bodice ? unlikely - young Mr. Turner will be dead long before you can reach him.

Elizabeth : [follows him as he knocks on a tree trunk then takes four steps and jumps up and down a few times] But you?re Captain Jack Sparrow . You vanished from under the eyes of seven agents of the East India Company. You sacked Nassau Port without even firing a shot. Are you the pirate I?ve read about or not? How did you escape last time?

Jack : Last time?I was here a grand total of three days, all right? Last time [opens a secret cellar door] ?the rumrunners used this island as a cache. Came by, and I was able to barter a passage off. From the looks of things, they?ve long been out of business. Probably?have your bloody friend Norrington to thank for that. [climbs out with two bottles of rum in his hands]

Elizabeth : So that?s it then? That?s the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow ? You spent three days lying on a beach, drinking rum?!

Jack : Welcome to the Caribbean , love. [hands her a bottle]

Elizabeth and Jack : [singing and dancing around a fire] We're devils and black sheep and really bad eggs. Drink up me 'earties yo ho! Yo ho, yo ho a pirate's life for me.

Jack : I love this song! Really bad eggs! Ooh. [falls] When I get the Pearl back, I?m gonna teach it to the whole crew, and we?ll sing it all the time!

Elizabeth : And you?ll be positively the most fearsome pirate in the Spanish Main .

Jack : Not just the Spanish Main , love. The entire ocean. The entire wo?ld. Wherever we want to go, we?ll go. That?s what a ship is, you know. It?s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails that's what a ship needs but what a ship is?what the Black Pearl really is?is freedom.

Elizabeth : Jack ?it must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island.

Jack : Oh, yes. [puts his arm around her shoulder] But the company is infinitely better than last time, I think. The scenery has definitely improved.

Elizabeth : Mr. Sparrow ?I?m not entirely sure that I?ve had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

Jack : I know exactly what you mean, love. [curls his moustache]

Elizabeth : [toasts] To freedom.

Jack : To the Black Pearl . [drinks and loses consciousness; wakes in the morning to the smell of smoke; sees the island burning and runs to Elizabeth ] No! Not good! Stop! Not good! What are you doing? You burned all the food, the shade! The rum!

Elizabeth : Yes, the rum is gone.

Jack : Why is the rum gone?

Elizabeth : One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels. Two, that signal is over a thousand feet high. The entire Royal Navy is out looking for me, do you really think that there is even the slightest chance that they won?t see it?

Jack : But why is the rum gone?

Elizabeth : [she sits to stare at the horizon] Just wait, Captain Sparrow. You give it one hour, maybe two, keep a weather eye out and then you will see white sails on that horizon.

Jack : [takes out pistol, thinks better of it and puts it back, stalks off, imitates Elizabeth ] ?Must?ve been terrible for you to be trapped here, Jack . Must?ve been terrible for you.? Well it bloody is now! [spots the Dauntless] There?ll be no living with her after this.

Scene 20: (A future wedding and Bootstrap?s bootstraps)

Elizabeth : But we?ve got to save Will .

Governor Swann : No. You?re safe now. We will return to Port Royal immediately, not go gallivanting after pirates!

Elizabeth : Then we condemn him to death.

Governor Swann : The boy?s fate is regrettable, but, then, so was his decision to engage in piracy.

Elizabeth : To rescue me. To prevent anything from happening to me.

Jack : If I may be so bold as to inject my professional opinion. The Pearl was listing near to scuppers after the battle. It?s very unlikely she?ll be able to make good time. Think about it. The Black Pearl . The last real pirate threat in the Caribbean , mate. How can you pass that up?

Norrington: By remembering that I serve others, Mr. Sparrow , not only myself.

Elizabeth : Commodore, I beg you, please do this. For me. As a wedding gift.

Governor Swann : Elizabeth . Are you accepting the Commodore?s proposal?

Elizabeth : I am.

Jack : A wedding! I love weddings?drinks all around! [extends his arms] I know. ?Clap him in irons,? right?

Norrington: Mr. Sparrow , you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us with the bearing to Isla de Muerta . You will then spend the rest of the voyage contemplating all possible meanings of the phrase ?silent as the grave.? Do I make myself clear?

Jack : Inescapably clear.

[in the brig of the Black Pearl ; Pintel and Ragetti are swabbing the floor] Parrot: Awwk, shiver me timbers.

Gibbs : Cotton ?ere says you missed a bit.

Will : [to Pintel] You knew William Turner ?

Pintel: Ol? Bootstrap Bill . We knew him. Never sat well with Bootstrap what we did to Jack Sparrow , the mutiny and all. He said it wasn?t right with the Code. That?s why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you as it were. He said we deserved to be cursed? and remain cursed.

Ragetti: Stupid blighter.

Gibbs : Good man.

Pintel: Well, as you can imagine that didn?t sit too well with the Captain.

Ragetti: That didn?t sit too well with the Captain, at all. Tell him what Barbossa did.

Pintel: I?m telling the story! So?what the Captain did, he strapped a cannon to Bootstraps? bootstraps.

Ragetti: Bootstraps? bootstraps.

Pintel: The last we saw of ol? Bill Turner , he was sinking to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones? Locker. ?Course it was only after that we learned we needed his blood to lift the curse.

Ragetti: That?s what you call ironic.

Barbossa: [comes down and throws the key to Will ?s cell to Ragetti] Bring him!

[in a boat with the rest of the soldiers and Jack ] Norrington: I don?t care for the situation. Any attempt to storm the caves could turn to an ambush.

Jack : Not if you?re the one doing the ambushing. I go in, I convince Barbossa to send his men out with their little boats. You and your mates return to the Dauntless and blast the bejesus outta them with your little cannons, eh? [puts an arm on Norrington?s shoulder] What do you have to lose?

Norrington: [peels off the arm] Nothing I?d lament being rid of.

Jack : Now, to be quite honest with you, there?s still a slight risk for those aboard the Dauntless which includes the future Mrs. Commodore .

[on the Dauntless] Gillette : [pulling Elizabeth along with another soldier] Sorry, but for your own safety.

Elizabeth : Coward! The commodore ordered ? I have to tell him! The pirates! They?re cursed! They cannot be killed!

Gillette : Don?t worry, miss, he?s already informed of that. A little mermaid flopped up on deck and told him the whole story. [shuts the doors]

Elizabeth : This is Jack Sparrow ?s doing! [she is locked in]

Scene 21: (The blood ritual, again, interrupted)

[on the way to the Aztec gold] Pintel: [to Will ] No reason to fret. It?s just a prick of the finger, a few drops of blood.

Twigg: No mistakes this time. He?s only half-Turner. We spill it all!

Pintel: Guess there is reason to fret.

Jack : [pushing through the crowd of pirates] Beg your pardon.

Barbossa: [is ready to slit Will ?s throat] Begun by blood?

Jack : Excuse me.

Barbossa: ?by blood un ?

Will: Jack !

Barbossa: S?not possible.

Jack : Not probable.

Will : Where?s Elizabeth ?

Jack : She?s safe, just like I promised. She's all set to marry Norrington, just like she promised. And you get to die for her, just like you promised. So we're all men of our word really except for Elizabeth who is, in fact, a woman.

Barbossa: Shut up! You?re next. [leans in to slit Will ?s throat again]

Jack : You don?t want to be doing that, mate.

Barbossa: No, I really think I do.

Jack : Your funeral.

Barbossa: Why don?t I want to be doing it?

Jack : Well, because [pushed a pirate?s arm off his shoulder] ?because the HMS Dauntless, pride of the Royal Navy, is floating just offshore. Waiting for you.

[in the boats] Murtogg: What are we doing here?

Mullroy: The pirates come out, unprepared and unawares, we catch ?em in the crossfire, send them down to see Old Hob.

Murtogg: I know why we?re here. I mean why aren?t we doing what it was ? what Mr. Sparrow said we should do. With the cannons and all?

Norrington: Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

Murtogg: You think he wasn?t telling the truth?

[in the cave] Jack : Just hear me out, mate. You order your men to row out to the Dauntless. They do what they do best. Robert ?s your Uncle, Fannie ?s your Aunt, there you are with two ships. The makings of your very own fleet. ?Course you?ll take the grandest as your flagship, and who?s to argue? But what of the Pearl ? Name me Captain, I?ll sail under your colors, I?ll give you ten percent of me plunder and you get to introduce yourself as?Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?

Barbossa: I s?pose in exchange, you want me not to kill the whelp.

Jack : No, no, not at all by all means, kill the whelp. Just not yet. Wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment. For instance? [picks up a few medallions] after you?ve killed Norrington?s men? [throws them back as he speaks] every? last? one. [pockets one]

Will : [sees Jack take a piece of the gold] You?ve been planning this from the beginning. Ever since you learned my name.

Jack : Yeah.

Barbossa: I want fifty percent of your plunder.

Jack : Fifteen.

Barbossa: Forty.

Jack : Twenty-five. And I?ll buy you the hat. A really big one?Commodore.

Barbossa: We have an accord. [they shake hands]

Jack : All hand?s to the boats! [sees Barbossa look at him askance] Apologies. You give the orders.

Barbossa: Gents?take a walk. [the pirates walk away]

Jack : Not to the boats? [the cursed pirates walk on the sea?s floor to the Dauntless, the moonlight revealing their true form]

Scene 22: (Just like Troy and an epic battle)

[in the boats] Norrington: [sees women in a boat] Hold fire.

Ragetti: [dressed in a dress and holding a parasol] This is just like what the Greeks done at Troy . ?Cept they was in a horse?instead of dresses. Wooden horse. [while they?re distracting the soldiers and sailors the pirates are boarding the Dauntless]

[on the Dauntless] Governor Swann : [to guard] A moment, please. Elizabeth ? I just want you to know I, uh, I believe you made a very good decision today. Couldn?t be more proud of you. [while he talks she throws down a makeshift rope and climbs out into a waiting boat] But, you know, even a good decision if made for the wrong reasons can be a wrong decision.

Sailor: [spots boat with two women] Lieutenant?

Ragetti: Yoo-hoo!

Governor Swann : Elizabeth ? Are you there? Elizabeth , are you even listening to me? [enters and sees makeshift rope] Oh, what have you done?

Ragetti: Oooh!

Pintel: Stop that! Already feel like a fool.

Ragetti: You look nice, though.

Pintel: I look nice?! [they fight and are revealed; the soldiers on board spot the invading pirates and they fight]

[in the cave; Jack examines the treasure] Barbossa: I must admit, Jack , I thought I had ye figured. But it turns out that you?re a hard man to predict.

Jack : Me? I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly? stupid. [unsheathes a pirate?s sword and throws it to Will ; Jack starts fighting with Barbossa]

Barbossa: You?re off the edge of the map, mate. Here there be monsters.

[on the Black Pearl ; Elizabeth comes on board] Grapple: Right. What would you pick to eat first?

Pirate Guard: I think we should decide now. Just so we?re ready when the time comes.

Both: [monkey falls on cannon] What was that?

[down in the hold] Gibbs : Shh! [sees Elizabeth ] It?s Elizabeth !

[Ragetti and Pintel board and load the cannons, firing them at the approaching boats with the soldiers]

Norrington: [hears bell tolling] Make for the ship! Move!

[the Governor?s wig is being taken by a cursed pirate, he ends up fighting with a severed arm]

[in the cave] Barbossa: You can?t beat me, Jack . [Jack impales him, Barbossa sighs and, taking out the sword, impales Jack ]

Jack : [staggers into the moonlight to reveal a skeleton] That?s interesting. [reveals the medallion] I couldn?t resist, mate. [Barbossa and Jack fight; Jack runs upsets an end table] Sorry.

Barbossa: So what now, Jack Sparrow ? Will it be it two immortals locked in an epic battle until Judgment Day and trumpets sound? Hmm?

Jack : Or you could surrender.

Barbossa: Arr. [laughs and runs after Jack ]

[on the Black Pearl ; having just thrown both guards into the sea] Elizabeth : [runs out from the hold with crew] All of you with me. Will is in that cave and we must save him. Ready? And heave! Please, I need your help! Come on!

Parrot: Any port in the storm.

Gibbs : Cotton ?s right, we?ve got the Pearl .

Elizabeth : And what about Jack , you?re just going to leave him?

Sailor: Jack owes us a ship.

Gibbs : And there?s the code to consider.

Elizabeth : The code? You?re pirates. Hang the code, and hang the rules! They?re more like guidelines anyway. [rowing the boat alone to the cave] Bloody pirates.

Ragetti: hEY.

Pintel: What?

Ragetti: Is it supposed to be doing that? [points to the Pearl that?s sailing away]

Pintel: They?re stealing our ship!

Ragetti: Bloody pirates! [is knocked on the head and his wooden eye pops out] Ah, me eye! [crawls after it]

Scene 23: (One last shot)

[in the cave] Pirate: [to Will ] I?m gonna teach you the meaning of pain.

Elizabeth : [enters] Do you like pain? [knocks the pirate with heavy staff] Try wearing a corset. [helps Will up and sees Jack as a skeleton] Whose side is Jack on?

Will : At the moment? [they string 3 pirates together, stick a grenade into the middle one and push them out of the moonlight]

Pirate: No fair. [they explode]

Jack : [cuts his hand and bleeds on medallion, tosses it to Will ; Barbossa aims pistol at Elizabeth ; Jack shoots Barbossa while he?s looking at Elizabeth ]

Barbossa: Ten years you carry that pistol, and now you waste your shot.

Will : He didn?t waste it. [drops both medallions into the chest]

Barbossa: [drops his sword and looks at the blood spreading from his wound] I feel?cold. [falls dead, an apple rolling from his hand; the curse now lifted]

[on board the Dauntless; Koehler suddenly falls dead after being run through by Norrington] Pintel: Parley? [while all the crew realize the curse has been lifted and surrender]

Norrington: The ship is ours, gentlemen.

Sailors and soldiers: Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! [the Governor joins them]

[in the cave] Elizabeth : We should return to the Dauntless.

Will : Your fianc will be wanting to know you?re safe. [ Elizabeth turns away]

Jack : [swaggers over to Will ] If you were waiting for the opportune moment?that was it. Now, if you?ll be so kind, I?d be much obliged if you?d drop me off my ship.

[Will rowing them in a boat to the Dauntless] Elizabeth : I?m sorry, Jack.

Jack : They done what?s right by them. Can?t expect more than that.

Scene 24: (The interrupted hanging and the escape)

Official: [reading a proclamation] Jack Sparrow , be it known that you have?

Jack : [standing on the gallows] Captain, Captain Jack Sparrow .

Official: ?for your willful commission of crimes against the crown. Said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature, the most egregious of these to be cited herewith ? piracy, smuggling?

Elizabeth : [standing with her father and her future husband] This is wrong.

Governor Swann : Commodore Norrington is bound by the law. As are we all.

Official: ?impersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, impersonating a cleric of the Church of England?

Jack : [smiling] Ah, yes. [looks over at the executioner who glares at him]

Official: ?sailing under false colors, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity, depredation, and general lawlessness. And for these crimes you have been sentenced to be, on this day, hung by the neck until dead. May God have mercy on your soul.

Will : [walks through the crowd to the raised ground on which they stand] Governor Swann . Commodore. Elizabeth . I should have told you every day from the moment I met you. I love you. [walks away; the noose is put around Jack ?s neck]

Elizabeth : [notices Cotton?s parrot] I can?t breathe. [falls backward; the drums sound]

Governor Swann : Elizabeth . [he and the Commodore help her]

Will: Move! [throws sword as Jack falls through, the sword sticks in the wood and Jack has a foothold; he fights to the gallows and there cuts Jack free; they fight all the way up to a tower where they are cornered by Norrington?s men]

Norrington: [to Will ] I thought we might have to endure some manner of ill-conceived escape attempt but not from you.

Governor Swann : On our return to Port Royal , I granted you clemency. And this is how you thank me? By throwing in your lot with him? He?s a pirate!

Will : And a good man. [Jack points to himself proudly, mouths ?That?s me.?] If all I have achieved here is that the hangman will earn two pairs of boots instead of one, so be it. At least my conscience will be clear.

Norrington: You forget your place, Turner.

Will : It?s right here?between you and Jack .

Elizabeth : [stands next to Will ] As is mine.

Governor Swann : Elizabeth ! Lower your weapons. For goodness? sake put them down! [the weapons are lowered]

Norrington: So this is where your heart truly lies, then?

Elizabeth : It is.

Jack : [notices the parrot] Well! I?m actually feeling rather good about this. [to Governor Swann ] I think we've all arrived at a very special place, eh? Spiritually?Ecumenically?Grammatically? [to Norrington] I want you to know that I was rooting for you, mate. Know that. Elizabeth ?it would never have worked between us, darling. I?m sorry. Will ?nice hat. Friends! This is the day that you will always remember as the day that ? [falls over battlement]

Gillette : Idiot. He has nowhere to go but back to the noose.

Sentry: Sail ho!

Gillette : What?s your plan of action? Sir?

Governor Swann : Perhaps on the rare occasion pursuing the right course demands an act of piracy, piracy itself can be the right course?

Norrington: Mr. Turner .

Will : [to Elizabeth ] I will accept the consequences of my actions.

Norrington: [unsheathes his sword] This is a beautiful sword. I would expect the man who made it to show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life.

Will : Thank you.

Gillette : Commodore! What about Sparrow?

Norrington: Well, I think we can afford to give him one day?s head start. [the soldiers leave with Norrington]

Governor Swann : So, this is the path you?ve chosen, is it? After all?he is a blacksmith.

Elizabeth : No. [takes off Will ?s hat] He?s a pirate. [the Governor walks away; Elizabeth and Will kiss]

Jack : [is heaved onboard the Black Pearl ; to Gibbs ] I thought you were supposed to keep to the Code.

Gibbs : We figured they were more actual?guidelines. [helps Jack up]

Jack : [ Cotton hands him his hat] Thank you.

Anamaria: Captain Sparrow [puts his coat around his shoulders] ?the Black Pearl is yours.

Jack : [walks over to the helm and looks around fondly] On deck, you scabrous dogs! Man the braces! Let down and haul to run free. Now...bring me that horizon. [hums and takes out his compass] And really bad eggs?drink up, me 'earties, yo ho.

END

[After the credits]

[ Jack the monkey emerges from the water and scampers over to the chest with the Aztec gold; he takes one of the medallions and is cursed once more; the moonlight shows the monkey as a skeleton and screeching, he jumps at the camera]
