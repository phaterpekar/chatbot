[Open on a shot of the God of the Sea, Poseidon, holding his Trident. The wind howls outside. More shots of mermaids, sea creatures, pieces of paper that adorn the walls. A Jolly Roger hangs on the covered walls as a shadow moves in low light. It moves past a large paper labeled FATHER'S CURSE, counting each day and year, crossing them out.
A boy takes a rope and puts it around his shoulders. We see a bounty poster, Wanted Dead or Alive, for JACK SPARROW. The boy approaches a sheet of paper and exhales, steeling himself, before grabbing a map off the wall. The map shows a Lighthouse, Port Royal across the bay, Skull Point, and one other spot with an X in the middle of the square they form. He leaves.
A fire burns in the lighthouse, shining a light out onto the sea, where the boy is in a rowboat, using the moonlight to guide him. He struggles with the oars, but rows persistently. After he's a good distance away, he stops and pulls out his map, double-checking it. He looks around, then puts it away.
The boy stands, tying the rope around his ankle. He picks up the other end, which has a net weighted with rocks, and drops it off the boat. The makeshift anchor sinks and the boy inhales deeply before plunging below the surface. He drops...until the rocks hit wooden planks.
Pan out to a giant ship underwater, slowly rising. The boy holds on to the deck as hard as he can until the ship bursts forth from the waves and out onto the surface. It is the FLYING DUTCHMAN.
The boy coughs and gasps as the water drains from the deck of the ship. He pushes himself on his hands and knees. The ship seems to be, once again, slowly being overtaken by sea life. The Captain is not upholding his job as well as he should. A curtain of seaweed hangs above the boy as he stands and looks around.
Footsteps approach. A figure can vaguely be seen by the Captain's Cabin]
BOY: Father?
MAN: Henry, what have you done?
HENRY: I said I'd find you.
[The figure steps out, revealing himself to be WILLIAM TURNER, making the boy his son, HENRY TURNER]
WILL: Look at me, son. [Will is slowly being overcome with coral and sea life. His hair is long, at least shoulder length. He looks haunted.]
HENRY: I don't care.
WILL: There's no place for you on the Dutchman. [Will looks around as he hears the murmurs of his crew. He looks slightly disturbed at the thought of them finding his son.] They know you're here. Go home to your mother.
HENRY: No!
WILL: Leave, now! [He draws his sword and severs the rope around Henry's ankle] Before it's too late.
HENRY: I won't! I'll never stop. And if you throw me over, I'll come straight back.
WILL: [Sheathes his sword] Don't you see I'm cursed to this ship?
HENRY: That's why I’m here. I think I know a way to break your curse. To free you from the Dutchman.
WILL: Henry, no.
HENRY: I've read about a treasure. A treasure that holds all the power of the sea. The Trident of Poseidon can break your curse.
WILL: [Moves forward and hugs his son tightly] Henry, the Trident can never be found.
HENRY: [hugging him back] I found you.
WILL: It's just a tale.
HENRY: [pulls back to look at his father] Like the tales of you and Captain Jack Sparrow? He will help me find the Trident.
WILL: You stay away from Jack. Leave the sea forever. You have to stop acting like-
HENRY: A pirate? I won't stop. I want you to come home.
[The DUTCHMAN slowly begins to sink beneath the waves. Henry looks down as water flows over his feet.]
WILL: Henry...I'm sorry. But my curse will never be broken. [Will reaches up and tears off the necklace he's worn since Dead Man's Chest.] This is my fate. [He presses it into Henry's hand.] You must let me go. [Will cups his son's cheek briefly, strokes it.] I love you, son.
[Father and son stand on the deck looking at each other as the DUTCHMAN returns beneath the waves. Henry flails and starts to keep himself afloat. Will closes his eyes and sinks with his ship. Henry surfaces, gasping for air, and pulls himself into his boat, falling back into it. He holds Will's necklace in his left hand.]
HENRY: Captain Jack Sparrow.
 NINE YEARS LATER
[Pan down to two ships on the sea. One is in pursuit and firing upon the other. A hand sticks out of the side of the ship, holding a mirror that reflects the eyes of a young man, who watches the ship being fired on intently. Inside, the crew works tirelessly.]
SOLDIER 1: Keep even keel.
SOLDIER 2: Haul in on the lee side!
[This is a Navy ship, chasing a pirate ship, evidenced by the laughter from the first ship as it was fired upon.]
MADDOX: Faster, you pathetic bilge rats! You'll pump the bilge and fill the scuppers. We're chasing down pirates!
[The men grunt as they continue to work. Belowdeck is crowded.]
MAN: Henry, get back here. You don't wanna get kicked off another ship.
[The young man holding the mirror outside the ship has dirty blonde hair and dark eyes; this is a grown HENRY TURNER. He glances to the speaker.]
HENRY: It's a Dutch barque. Probably stolen by the pirate Bonnet. [He turns the mirror from the ship to the rock formation ahead; it is ominous and filled with fog. He studies the image for a minute as the men below cough from exertion. Realization dawns on him, and we can see he's wearing the necklace WILL TURNER gave him nine years ago.] My God. [Henry starts frantically splashing through the hold.]
MADDOX: I warned you of leaving your post, boy.
HENRY: [splashes up to the stairs on which Maddox stands] I need to speak with the captain.
MADDOX: What did you say?
HENRY: Move! [he pushes Maddox aside]
MADDOX: [grunts] Turner!
[Henry rushes abovedeck. An officer peers through a spyglass. There is the sound of cannonfire and men shouting indistinctly.]
OFFICER COLE: [watching the pirate ship approach the rock formation] She's going in, sir.
CAPTAIN TOMS: Chase her down.
HENRY: [pushing officers aside] No, don't do it! Don't do it! [he rushes towards the quarterdeck]
OFFICER COLE: [steps forward] You will not address the captain, boy.
HENRY: [stops, looking up at the officers and captain on quarterdeck] Sir, look at your charts. I believe you're sailing us into the Devil's Triangle.
CAPTAIN TOMS: [steps forward] You hear this, men? [Henry's shouting has caught the attention of all on deck] This landsman believes an old sailor's myth.
[Some of the crew titter and smirk]
HENRY: [takes one step forward, removing his tattered hat] Sir, with all due respect, I have spent my life studying the myths of the sea. I know every legend and every curse. And I know ships that sail into the Triangle do not necessarily sail out...
[Maddox approaches, finally catching up to Henry. He addresses the captain]
MADDOX: I'm sorry, sir. This one is clearly disturbed.
HENRY: Sir, trust in what I say. Change your course.
CAPTAIN TOMS: You dare to give me orders, boy?
OFFICER COLE: Arrest him!
[Henry looks to the side, then makes a dash for the quarterdeck stairs]
MADDOX: Turner!
HENRY: [running up the stairs, the crew on his tail] I will not let you kill us all!
[He makes for the helm, struggling with other officers. He flips one over his shoulder, then drives another into the deck, punching him. He is hauled off by a third and held fast, where he is struck by a fourth and has muskets pointed directly at him.]
CAPTAIN TOMS: This is treason. [he takes Henry's sleeves and rips them]
HENRY: No.
CAPTAIN TOMS: Lock him up. We're going in!
HENRY: No!
SOLDIER 1: Belay that starboard brace.
SOLDIER 2: Bind that line!
SOLDIER 3: Stay to the chains!
[Henry, belowdeck, is led to the brig, being dragged]
MADDOX: This was your last chance, Turner. [Henry is thrown into the brig, papers flying out from his tattered coat. They are wanted posters for JACK SPARROW] If it were up to me, I'd string you from the yardarm. [to the two marines with him] On deck. [The three walk away as more soldiers are heard shouting. A hand reaches through the bars to pick up one of the wanted posters]
SOLDIER: Hold steady, helmsman!
[The hand belongs to an older man, weathered with a beard. He looks at the poster.]
MAN: Jack Sparrow. He's dead. [Henry looks up at him, still lying on the floor] Buried in an unmarked grave on the Isle of Saint Martin.
[The Navy's ship enters the mouth of the Devil's Triangle. Birds caw eerily. Wood creaks. The officers on deck look around. Henry gasps belowdeck as everything goes dark and the ship is shrouded in fog. Captain Toms looks at his charts, seeing they are at the Devil's Triangle. The first officer walks to the taffrail and looks over]
FIRST OFFICER WADE: Sir, there's something in the water. [It's a flag with pirate's colors.]
OFFICER COLE: Ship to starboard!
FIRST OFFICER WADE: That's no ship, sir. It's a shipwreck.
[Figures race across the top of the water, unseen]
CAPTAIN TOMS: No. She's sailing straight toward us.
[A figure passes some of the marines, causing them to turn uneasily]
CAPTAIN TOMS: Open fire! Open fire!
[The Navy ship fires on the unknown vessel]
SOLDIER 1: Reload!
[Henry looks out the small hole in the brig, seeing nothing but fog.]
SOLDIER 2: Secure the deck!
[Henry hears soldiers screaming as above, a figure races forward and skewers a marine from behind. The crew is being slaughtered in the dark by these mysterious figures. One drops a lantern and fire burns on the deck. A pair of boots lands, using two swords to help him walk. He slaughters crewmembers left and right easily. His hair flows unnaturally. Belowdeck, Henry looks up, seeing smoke and soot float through the air. The figure approaches Captain Toms]
CAPTAIN TOMS: What are you? [he chokes as the figure picks him up, one-handed, and lifts him by his neck]
MYSTERIOUS FIGURE: Death.
[He snaps Captain Toms' neck and drops him in the growing blaze. In the brig, Henry reaches out between the bars to feel the blood from above drip onto his hand. He gasps and stumbles backwards, knocking over a barrel with a clatter. The figure above hears, turning his head down. Henry looks up as he hears footsteps approaching the stairs. The other man in the brig whimpers as the mysterious figure descends, still difficult to see. He is followed by other men.
The figure walks through the bars as if they were not there. Henry gasps and backs up again. The man in the cell next to him whimpers louder. The figure skewers one of the JACK SPARROW posters and looks at it. This figure is CAPTAIN ARMANDO SALAZAR.]
 SALAZAR: Jack Sparrow. [He has a Hispanic accent] Shh!
[The old man groans as one of Salazar's crew moves forward and guts him, killing him.]
SALAZAR: [moves towards Henry, holding the poster] Do you know this pirate?
HENRY: Only by name.
SALAZAR: You're looking for him? [as he draws closer to Henry, his features are more distinguished. His face is cracked. His lips are black, his skin is mottled and pale. Only half his body is there. He is, in fact, a nightmarish GHOST, or SPECTER. Henry swallows and looks at the other crewmembers; one only has the bottom half of his jaw, everything above his mouth obliterated. He doesn't answer. Salazar becomes impatient.] Is that a "yes"?
HENRY: [nods slightly] Yes.
SALAZAR: [turns away] For too many years, the Triangle has cursed us...condemned us to this Hell on Earth. The key to our escape is Jack Sparrow...and the compass which he holds. [He sees Henry breathing hard, with wide eyes.] No need to fear me, boy. I always leave one man alive to tell the tale. [A horrible smile stretches across his face, blood dribbling from his mouth.] Find Sparrow for me...and relay a message from Captain Salazar. Salazar. Tell him I will behold the daylight again. And on that day...death... [blood dribbles from his mouth]...death will come straight for him. Would you say that to him? Please?
HENRY: Yes.
SALAZAR: I wish I could do it myself, but...dead men tell no tales.
[The scene pans up to the burning wreckage, and the title shows. Cut to a lush Caribbean colony: ST. MARTIN.]
PRIEST: Carina Smyth, you're an orphan born of the devil, accused of practicing witchcraft.
[Cut to a jail, where a priest is speaking to a young woman inside. She has dark hair and blue eyes.]
PRIEST: Before you die, do you have anything to confess?
CARINA: I confess that I'm not a witch. That I am a woman of science. I confess that I have survived on my own with nothing but a diary from the father I never knew. [Her manacled hands are carefully working at the lock, careful not to draw the priest's attention. Her eyes are cast downward.] I confess I will die before I give up the search. And I confess... [she looks up] That while we've been talking, I picked this lock. [She throws the door open, knocking the priest over, and runs from the jail as the priest lies there, stunned.]
[Outside, a large crowd has gathered in the square, applauding]
MAYOR DIX: Today, we dedicate the Royal Bank of Saint Martin.
[Carina peers around a building, watching the passers-by and the crowd. She watches as two officials open the large door and people gasp and applaud, seeing a large safe inside. Carina runs while attention is diverted.]
MAYOR DIX: The most secure banking institute in the Caribbean. Our new vault is five inches thick and weighs an imperial ton.
SOLDIER: I've got her! I've got her! [Carina is spotted] Get her! [he gives chase] Don't let her get away! Stop that witch!
[Carina runs through the side streets, only to stop and gasp]
SOLDIER: Stop her! She's there! Get out of the way!
MAYOR DIX: With this bank, the town of Saint Martin enters the modern world. [a clerk moves inside to start opening the vault.]
[In the sidestreet, the soldiers push through the crowd and meet with others at a fork.]
SOLDIER: I'm so sorry, sir. The witch escaped her chains.
CAPTAIN: Find that wicked lass, or you'll swing in her place.
SOLDIER: Sir.
MAYOR DIX: No man nor an army can ever rob the gold from Saint Martin! [the crowd applauds] Open the vault.
[The clerk opens the vault and the crowd gasps as coins clink and JACK SPARROW is seen passed out on the shelves full of riches, feet up in the air, arm dangling off onto the floor of the vault. The crowd murmurs at the sight of the famous pirate snoring, and the clerk dashes out.]
WOMAN: [points] Pirate!
[There's a gasp, and Jack stirs.]
JACK: Pirate... [there's jeers, and he bolts awake] Pirate! [he rolls off the shelf, onto the floor, and tumbles out of the vault. He stumbles to his feet, muttering, bottle of rum in one hand] Hmm. This may seem a peculiar request...but could someone explain to me as to why I'm here?
[On the other side of the bank, Jack's crewmember MARTY secures a line. There are four rows of horses, three horses per row, all roped to the back of the bank. JOSHAMEE GIBBS heads the operation, speaking to the newest crewmember]
GIBBS: Scrum. How long?
[Out front, soldiers are shouting and swarming the platform in front of the bank]
JACK: No, wait, it's coming to me. I need just a moment to clear me head. [he uncorks the bottle of rum and takes a long swig]
SOLDIER: Make ready! [the soldiers kneel, aiming] Present! [Jack continues to drink. A woman, FRANCES, moans in the vault, slowly coming to.] Hold your fire! There's a woman with him in the vault!
[Out back, Jack's crew rushes to put their plan into action.]
MAYOR DIX: Never mind about that trollop.
MAN: Sir, I believe that's your wife.
[There's an audible gasp as Frances stands, clutching her chest, gathering her skirts, and running. She stops, seeing her husband.]
MAYOR DIX: Frances?
[She gasps, then runs into the crowd. Jack is facing away from everyone at this point, hand on his forehead]
JACK: Right, I've got it. [He turns back to the crowd, grinning] I'm robbing the bank!
MAYOR DIX: Shoot him!
JACK: Ooh! [he drops to the ground as the soldiers open fire]
GIBBS: Come on! [he spurs the horses forward] Pull!
[The ropes, which are attached to the back of the vault, pull it to the back of the bank. It gets stuck on the building. Marty urges the horses forward.]
MARTY: Pull!
GIBBS: Come on!
[Jack looks back and scrambles to his feet as the entire bank starts to shift. He watches, dumbfounded, as the entire building is dragged away, then puts on his trusty hat. He turns back to the crowd.]
JACK: That was not part of the plan. [A rope catches his ankle and pulls him along, sending him face-first into the dirt]
SOLDIER: After him! Don't let him get away!
GIBBS: Yo! Come on!
[Jack drinks as he rights himself enough to be sitting upright as he's dragged along with the bank. Coins spill from the vault. He tries to catch the money as it flies out. Pandemonium ensues.
In the commotion, on another side street, Carina falls off the wagon she had jumped into, panting. She runs into a nearby building, ignoring the sign that says "NO DOGS" and "NO WOMEN". She looks around the instruments inside with wonder, stopping before a giant telescope. As she peers through it, the owner, MR. SWIFT, sees her.]
SWIFT: [aghast] No woman's ever handled my Herschel. [Carina looks at him with some scorn and disbelief as Swift closes his book.]
[Back in the streets, hijinks continue to ensue.]
GIBBS: Clear a path! Oh, no, no, no!
SCRUM: Stop! Stop! Stop! [he tries to cover himself from the pieces of the bank that are flying apart in the narrow streets]
[Jack waves at giggling ladies before climbing into the bank]
GIBBS: Hard to starboard!
[The horses round a corner, the bank swinging with it. Jack screams as he's flung from the building and shoots through another's window, tumbling down the stairs. He rights himself.
The shot goes back to Carina inside with the Swift.]
CARINA: Sir, your celestial fix was off. I've adjusted two degrees North. [Swift goes to look at his charts as she speaks.] Your map will no longer be imprecise, although you will have to start again with it.
SWIFT: [looks at the charts, to her, slowly pointing] You're a witch.
CARINA: [impatiently] No, I'm not. [she puts her shackled wrist behind her back] Am I a witch for having catalogued over two-hundred stars?
SWIFT: Witch!
CARINA: [sighs, turning away] There is a blood moon coming. [She moves towards an instrument in a box] I simply need to purchase a chronometer. [She picks up said device, which looks like a cross between a pocketwatch and a compass] I'll pay you double for selling to a woman.
SWIFT: [he has since pulled out a small pistol and holds it shakily] Help!
[Carina turns around, surprised. Jack is out stumbling on the streets, hearing the shouting]
SWIFT: There's a witch in my shop! Help! [Jack drinks, walking through the running soldiers] Help! There's a witch in my shop! [Jack stumbles in, nearly running right into Carina, who has her hands up] And a pirate! There's a witch and a pirate in my shop!
JACK: Well, it's your lucky day! Have either of the four of you seen my bank?
[The bank crashes against the building, bringing part of the shop down]
JACK: Found it!
[People scream in the streets as Jack's chaos ensues. He's currently running, Carina following, her skirts held in her hands]
JACK: Were you part of the plan?
CARINA: I'm not looking for trouble.
JACK: What a horrible way to live. [They round a corner]
[Soldiers are hot in pursuit, but when they round the corner seconds later, the pair are gone. Jack and Carina finish climbing a ladder to higher ground. They're spotted.]
SOLDIER 1: Stop that witch! Get her!
CARINA: [looks at the other rooftops, then down below] We're trapped. What do we do? [She and Jack look at each other]
SOLDIER 2: Yeah, there she is! Quickly!
JACK: [grabs both of Carina's arms] You need to scream. [he bodily shoves her into a cart full of hay below, and Carina does scream, loudly]
SOLDIER 3: Over there! Secure that woman!
[The horses of the cart, spooked, take off running]
CARINA: You filthy pirate!
JACK: [watches her getting pulled away] No need for name-calling!
[Gibbs continues urging the horses as Jack saunters from rooftop to rooftop, following the bank, which is now running parallel to him. Jack takes a running leap, screaming, and uses a flagpole to hop onto the bank. He steadies himself and grins. Gibbs looks back, sees Jack, then points ahead at a low-hanging bridge]
GIBBS: Jack!
JACK: Huh? [his confident expression falls] Bridge?
[the crew on horseback duck under while Jack jumps, running over the stone bridge, the bank destroyed in the process of this madness. Jack yells, flailing, and falls directly onto the vault, the only thing left of the bank. The destruction of the bank halts the chase.
On board a ship, Jack opens the empty vault, his crew gathered eagerly behind him. Jack looks around and sees one coin, pocketing it quickly before Scrum runs up. Jack drums his fingers as Scrum looks around the vault then turns to the crew]
SCRUM: It's empty!
[everyone groans]
PIRATE: Where is the dosh?
JACK: Do you think that robbing a bank is easy? [turns to the crew] You gaggle of gutless heels of the womb's guilty of putting me in this dreadful pickle in the first place. [the crew looks shocked and disgruntled, especially ones like Marty and Gibbs] Now line up and offer me your tribute.
MARTY: You want us to pay you?!
JACK: Am I not the captain of this ship?
[pan out to a ship, abandoned and docked for quite a while, lumber leaning against it. It seems like it was pulled ashore on a ramp for repairs and simply left. This is the DYING GULL, Jack's current ship]
CREMBLE: You call this a ship? Where's the treasure?
PIRATE: All of us are starving.
CREMBLE: We will no longer follow a captain without a ship.
JACK: I have a ship. [he looks indignant, reaching into his coat to pull out a small bottle. Inside, rocking on the waves, is Jack's beloved ship, the] Black Pearl has never left me side.
[everyone scoffs]
PIRATE: The pirate Barbossa rules these seas now. [others nod] Has ten ships, guns full.
PIRATE 2: Not to mention his cannonballs. Eighteen pounds each, they say.
JACK: One-legged man with eighteen-pound balls? THAT'S why he walks funny. [Gibbs looks unamused at Jack's joke] Oh, come on, mates. Did we not find the Treasure of Macedonia together?
PIRATE 2: It was a troll of rotten wood.
JACK: [points triumphantly] Gold of King Midas.
PIRATE 2: Pile of donkey dung.
JACK: [curses]
GIBBS: Face it, Jack. [Jack looks at him, completely shocked that his first mate, who has been loyal to him through everything, is speaking out] Bad luck dogs you day and night.
JACK: Now that is a blatant fabrication. [a seagull poops on his shoulder as if to prove him wrong. Jack clears his throat]
CREMBLE: You've lost your luck. You've lost your ship. [people are turning away]
MARTY: Now, you've lost your crew. [he turns and follows the others, to Jack's shock]
PIRATE: Jack Sparrow is no longer our captain.
[Jack watches them all go, his eyes widening slightly as Gibbs approaches him slower. The first made looks tired, haggard, and sad]
GIBBS: I'm sorry, Jack. But we've reached the end of the horizon. [he claps Jack's shoulder a few times, while Jack stares at him in disbelief. Shaking his head sadly, Gibbs turns and follows the other men.
Jack looks...lost. His gaze darts around, and he strides to the edge of the DYING GULL]
JACK: Right then. You're all dismissed. Eh? All of ya, dismissed. [he's speaking to retreating figures. A few make rude gestures back] You'll never sail with Captain Jack Sparrow again, tell you that. [Jack pulls out his compass and opens it, looking for what he wants. It points towards the sea, and he slowly moves up to the quarterdeck of the DYING GULL, looking out at the ocean. He takes the small bottle that has the BLACK PEARL and sets it on the taffrail. He leans down until he's eye level, giving the illusion that the BLACK PEARL is sailing on the waves, out on the sea. This is what Jack's heart truly wants.
 In a new scene, Henry awakens in a bed. He hears a voice.]
SCARFIELD: The whole town speaks of you. [The man is a naval officer.] The only survivor of the Monarch. A boy who paddled all the way to Saint Martin against the tide on a piece of driftwood. [Henry looks down, seeing that he's shackled to the bed. He plucks at his restraints, trying to get his bearings] Found jabbering about pirates and tridents.
[A nurse nearby turns her head slightly]
HENRY: Please, sir, let me go of these chains.
SCARFIELD: My job is to protect this island and these waters. [he looks at the coat hanging by Henry's bed] And your sleeves have been ripped. [Henry looks at the jacket, sitting up a bit more, eyes wider] The mark of treason.
HENRY: We were attacked by the dead--
SCARFIELD: You're a coward who ran from battle. [He turns and walks away] And that is how you'll die.
[Henry catches his breath, obviously shaken, as a nurse approaches him with a bowl of water and a cloth. She wets it and dabs at his forehead. Henry pushes her hand away. The nurse sits.]
NURSE: I don't believe you're a coward.
HENRY: Please leave me, sister.
[The camera pans, revealing that the nurse is Carina]
CARINA: I've risked my life to come here, to see if the rumors are true. You speak of the Trident?
HENRY: Who are you?
CARINA: Tell me why you seek the Trident.
HENRY: [pauses] The Trident can break any curse at sea. My father is trapped by such a curse.
CARINA: You're aware that curses are not supported by science.
HENRY: Neither are ghosts.
CARINA: So you have gone mad? [she looks incredulous] I should never have come here.
HENRY: Then why did you come here?
CARINA: Because I need to get off this island. To solve the Map No Man--
HENRY & CARINA: No Man Can Read.
HENRY: Left by Poseidon himself.
CARINA: [inches forward, looking around briefly] You've read the ancient text?
HENRY: In each language they were written. But this map has never been seen nor read by any man.
CARINA: Luckily, I'm a woman. [she reaches beneath her apron, pulling out a book and looking around again to make sure no one is looking. She holds a worn leather book with a precious gem - a ruby - embedded into it. It has a cluster of five stars etched into it] This is the diary of Galileo Galilei. He spent his life searching for the Trident. It's why he invented the spyglass, why astronomers have spent their entire lives staring into the sky.
HENRY: So you're saying the Map No Man Can Read is hidden in the stars?
CARINA: It was left to me by my father. He believed I Could find what no man has ever found, and I will not let him down. Soon there will be a blood moon. [Henry sits up completely] Only then can the map be read. And the Trident found.
HENRY: Who are you?
CARINA: Carina Smyth.
[A marine walks in with Scarfield and another officer, pointing. Carina's been found]
CARINA: If you wish to save your father, you'll have to save me. [She pulls a pick out of her sleeve and hands it to him] Find us a ship and the Trident will be ours. [she hitches her skirts and hops over the bed, starting to run]
SCARFIELD: [runs after her] Turn to me, witch.
[Carina tries to run, makes it as far as the doorway, but is caught and pressed against the wall, restrained by an officer]
SOLDIER: He's gone!
[Scarfield turns to see Henry's empty bed]
SOLDIER: He's gone, sir!
[in the short distraction Carina had made, Henry had picked the lock and escaped through the window next to his bed]
SCARFIELD: Find that coward. He'll hang with the witch.
SOLDIER: Move out!
 [Jack wanders the streets of Saint Martin, alone in the rain, soaked through]
JACK: Think Captain Jack's washed up, eh? I've not had a wash in years. [We see his face, and it's somber. Jack is realizing his crew may be right after all. He sees officers up ahead]
SOLDIER: Check the alley down there. You two, check the church. The rest of you, with me.
[Seeing them mobilize, Jack climbs onto a fence. He yelps, losing his balance]
JACK: Bugger. [he falls face-first into a pigsty. Absolutely caked in mud from head to foot, he grabs his compass and heads to a tavern across the street. He opens the door and his face falls, seeing his own wanted posters on the walls. It falls further. Originally, his bounty had been 100 pounds. Then 50. Then 25. 10. Finally, a 1 pound reward, Dead or Alive. Unrecognizable in the mud, he just looks offended. He walks up to the bar] May I have a drink, please?
BARKEEP: Show me your silver.
JACK: Silver? [he briefly pats himself down, but realizes he has nothing left. He slowly looks at his compass, which has never left his side except when he needed it to in At World's End -- never truly given away willingly. He looks at it for a long moment] ...how about a trade? Give me the bottle. [he smacks the compass on the wood.
Almost instantly, everything begins to shake around them. Jack holds his hands up as the earth itself rumbles.
In the DEVIL'S TRIANGLE, the water ripples, and we see Salazar's ship, SILENT MARY. Salazar is humming to himself, leaning against the taffrail. The rocks in the dark triangle rumble, the light of day finally shining onto the captain's face. He glances over, watching the rocks crumble and fall.
In the tavern, bottles fall off the shelves and shatter. Jack moves for the compass, but the barkeep snatches it and smacks a bottle down in front of Jack instead, tossing it behind him into a barrel full of valuables from others who have traded for alcohol. Jack watches the compass spin, slowly.
The helm of the SILENT MARY reflects the compass turning, moving on its own, in a camera shot as one of Salzar's men speaks]
LIEUTENANT LESARO: Capitán, what's happening?
SALAZAR: Jack Sparrow. Jack Sparrow has given away the compass.
[The prison around them continues to crumble. The SILENT MARY moves through the waters for the first time. Salazar moves to the edge of the quarterdeck.]
SALAZAR: Daylight. Daylight.
[Seagulls screech as the rest of the DEVIL'S TRIANGLE disappears and the crew is revealed even more horrific and pale in their washed-out half-forms, black smoke trailing behind them as they move. Salazar's hair swirls around him constantly, as if it has no gravity. Armando Salazar has been let loose into the world again]
SALAZAR: We are free! [his crew cheers as he throws his arms out, enjoying the sun and laughing] Now. Now, now. It's time to hunt a pirate.
[In the tavern, Jack lifts his bottle, watching a rodent scurry around the valuables, looking at his compass. He seems to consider it, then grins warily]
JACK: Pirate's life. [He stumbles out into the rain.
Elsewhere in Saint Martin, Henry sneaks from building to building. He sees Jack opening the bottle. This is the man he spent his entire life hearing stories of and searching for]
JACK: Come to daddy. Oh!
[A gunshot sounds, and troops walk up, led by Mayor Dix. Henry ducks out of sight]
MAYOR DIX: Just the man we've been looking for.
JACK: [as he's swarmed] Why? Why am I looked for? [he tries to drink, but is restrained as Henry watches from cover]
MAYOR DIX: Let it be known that the pirate, Jack Sparrow, will be executed at dawn.
JACK: Executed? I will never set foot in this town again, sir. You mark my words. [he's led away]
SOLDIER: Dead now, you cur.
JACK: I do mean it, you know. I shall never be back here again.
[Out on the ocean, there is a grand ship with off-white sails, flying a red flag with a skull, underneath it two swords. While the actual colors of the flag may have changed, these are the colors of Pirate Lord HECTOR BARBOSSA. On deck, a pirate whistles as he moves to a bucket of clean water, scooping it with a ladle and taking a long drink. There is the sound of wings flapping, and the pirate sighs, then tosses the ladle back in, glancing to his right to see a ghastly bird. It's a seagull that looks half-formed - half there. It squawks, missing the joint of one of its legs, but with the foot still attached somehow and moving. The pirate splashes his face and looks back over. The seagull is gone.
Thunder rumbles, and a ship can be seen in the distance where the gull once was. It bears down quickly upon the ship, rearing up and showing its rib-like underbelly. The pirate backs up rapidly, then sees the gull again. It spreads its wings and screeches loudly. The pirate screams to match it. Gulls swarm the ship, screaming, as the SILENT MARY overtakes one of Barbossa's ten ships.
In Saint Martin, Carina uses a metal lockpick to etch into her prison wall. A red glow slowly fills the prison, and she looks up. The blood moon fills her cell as the clouds pull away, and the ruby on the front of the diary glows in the light]
CARINA: Huh. [she picks at the ruby, finally managing to pry it free with a small gasp of surprise. She moves it slowly, revealing writing unseen on the front of the journal unless held under the ruby in the light of the blood moon. She reads aloud] "To release the power of the sea all must divide." [She moves the ruby down over the cluster of stars, finding something beneath the lowest hanging one, the hidden etching of...] It's an island. The stars lead to an island.
[Inside the prison, a guard hangs up his coat and hat, going inside a room with other guards out of uniform. As the door swings open slightly, the set is gone. Henry quickly dons the coat and hat, passing other soldiers as he moves further into the jail]
SOLDIER: Look here, sir.
SOLDIER 2: Very good. Take the rest to the cells.
HENRY: [after he's satisfied he wasn't discovered, he moves to the nearest cell] I'm looking for a pirate. Jack Sparrow.
INMATE: Bugger off.
HENRY: [quickly moves to the next cell] Psst! I need to speak with you. [he pauses, realizing the silhouette is of Jack Sparrow. He turns around to make sure no one else is around. Jack appears in his waistcoat, shirt, and bandanna, wrapping his arms around Henry's neck through the bars]
JACK: Hand me your sword.
HENRY: I don't have a sword.
JACK: What kind of soldier has no weapon?
HENRY: [tightly holding on to Jack's arm to prevent himself from being suffocated] I'm currently wanted for treason.
JACK: ...so not the very good kind, then.
HENRY: I'm looking for a pirate. Captain Jack Sparrow.
JACK: Well, today is your lucky day. [he releases Henry, who gasps for air and turns around as Jack steps back] 'Cause I just happen to be Captain Jack Sparrow. [Jack spreads his arms wide in a grand gesture. Henry stares, aghast at what he's seeing. Jack keeps posing expectantly]
HENRY: No, it can't be. [Jack nods] I've spent years searching for...this? The great Jack Sparrow is not some drunk in a cell. [Jack looks offended again, face souring. Little does Henry know the irony of this statement, as this is exactly how his father Will met Jack] Do you even have a ship? A crew? ...pants?
[Jack is indeed, pantsless - this is the only difference from Will and Jack's first meeting. Jack used his breeches on the dummy in the cell]
JACK: A great pirate does not require such intricacies.
HENRY: [still in disbelief] Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment? The risks I've taken to be here. Are you sure you're THE Jack Sparrow?
JACK: Real question is, who are you?
HENRY: My name is Henry Turner. [Jack's head rears back and his eyes go wide] Son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann.
JACK: Ugh! [he looks downright horrified] You're the evil spawn of them two?! [he looks Henry up and down, then his eyes light up. He moves closer] Does mummy ever ask about me? [Clearly, Jack is still attracted to the Elizabeth from his memory, and seems to be over the fact she left him for the Kraken...or his ensuing madness finds this all the more attractive in hindsight. It's Jack. Who knows]
HENRY: No.
JACK: Oh, go on. [he smirks, gripping the bars] She call my name in her sleep?
HENRY: She never spoke of you. [He's clearly lying; he's been told the tales, but it's doubtful Elizabeth talked personally about Jack]
JACK: Are you sure we're talking about the same people? HE'S a cursed eunuch. She's golden-haired, stubborn, pouty-lips. [Henry looks away uncomfortably, shifting at someone speaking of his parents in this manner] Neck like a giraffe. And two of those wonderful--
HENRY: Yes! Yes, it's her. [he regains his composure; he's very much like Will in that he seems like he wants to throttle Jack more than anything] I need you to listen, Jack, because at the moment, you're all I've got. [Jack eyes him, clearly seeing the resemblance as well] I found a way to save my father. There is one thing that can break his curse and free him from the Dutchman. [Henry pauses, moving a bit closer and speaking quieter] The Trident of Poseidon.
JACK: Ah. The treasure to be found with the Map That No Man Can Read. [he smiles, nodding. Henry smiles a bit hopefully, and warily. Jack pauses] Never heard of it.
HENRY: There is a girl inside this prison, Jack, who holds that map. The moon has turned to blood, the Trident will be found, and you could be the one who holds the sea, and with it become all that you once were. The great--
[Jack pretends to snore, leaning his head against the bars]
HENRY: Jack!
[Jack gasps "awake."]
JACK: I'm so sorry. Were you still talking? I believe I nodded off a bit.
HENRY: [he definitely wants to throttle Jack] One more thing. A message from someone you know named Captain Salazar.
JACK: [his face scrunches up as he thinks. It visibly twitches] I once knew a Spaniard named... [he turns away and walks towards the back of the cell, talking over his shoulder] ...something in Spanish.
HENRY: El Matador del Mar.
JACK: Him? No, no. [grinning] Quite happily, he's dead. Very, very dead. Ship went down.
HENRY: Inside the Triangle. He's coming for you, Jack, to seek revenge as the dead man's tale is told.
JACK: I don't believe you. [he whirls around and rushes the bars. Henry steps back] What did he say?
HENRY: He said your compass was the key to his escape. [Jack's brows furrow and we see he realizes exactly what happened] An army of dead are coming straight for you, Jack. The Trident of Poseidon is your only hope. Do we have an accord?
[Cut to a large, magnificent ship at night, bearing Barbossa's colors. We see two pirates fighting on a deck full of elegant things: gold armchairs, most pirates clad in finery, etc]
MULLROY: Well, I'm not going to tell him.
MURTOGG: It was your idea.
MULLROY: No, it was my idea for you to tell him.
MURTOGG: He likes you more than me.
MULLROY: He doesn't like anybody.
[The two are headed to the Captain's cabin. Inside, we see Hector Barbossa with a fully-grown beard and curled hair, aged. He lives a life of elegance, in his fine coat with lace trim, delicately picking shrimp from a gold dish, and a glass full of wine. Classical music plays in the background.
Despite this, we still see some of the Barbossa we know as he uses the skewer he just popped in his mouth for the shrimp to scratch an itch on his head. His peg leg, now golden, rests on a cushion, and his foot taps in time to the live music. He seems to be enjoying himself immensely. Some of the walls are adorned with skulls and human bones, showing Barbossa is still a pirate to be feared.
There's a knock on the door, and Murtogg and Mullroy enter. Mullroy has grown a full beard since last seen in At World's End. Murtogg appears to have some odd-looking mutton chops]
MULLROY: Sorry, sir. We know you said never to disturb you.
MURTOGG: Or to come in without good cause.
MULLROY: Or to speak without first, um... [Barbossa seems to be ignoring them, moving his hand as if conducting an orchestra] Asking ourselves...whether our thoughts were absolutely necessary.
[Barbossa looks up at the pair, unamused at being interrupted]
MURTOGG: Like the time the ship was on fire. That being an example of necessary thought.
MULLROY: Sir, again, we do apologize for starting that fire.
[Barbossa stands quickly, pulling a gun out from under the table and aiming at the musicians, firing. A shot hits the wall over their heads and they run out]
BARBOSSA: Speak.
MULLROY: It's your ships, sir. They're being attacked by an enemy that takes no riches.
MURTOGG: Kills without provocation.
BARBOSSA: My ships? Not possible.
MULLROY: Three have already been sunk, sir. They've been sunk by a captain called Salamander.
MURTOGG: [his agreeing expression falls and he turns to his longtime friend] Samovar.
BARBOSSA: [looks troubled] Salazar.
MULLROY: That's it, your sirness. He leaves one man from each vessel to tell the tale. The entire fleet is being sunk...and we'll soon be dead.
MURTOGG: And quite possibly out of business.
[Cut from Barbossa's troubled face to him striding down a prison hallway, confidently, using his peg-leg far better than he did in Upon Stranger Tides. He is actually in Saint Martin's prison, in a different area than Jack, Carina, and Henry. He's in a hat and cloak now as he approaches a marine]
BARBOSSA: I'll be needing some time with your witch. [he drops a pouch of coins into the marine's hand. The marine unlocks a door for him. Barbossa walks in, looking at a bald witch with her back to him. A long tattoo in Sanskrit swirls around her body, from her head downwards, and she has a large bindi on her forehead. This is SHANSA the sea-witch]
SHANSA: I've been expecting you, Captain. Perhaps you'd like some tea? [she finishes ladling some green goop into a cup and drinks it. Part of it sticks to her lips]
BARBOSSA: [chuckles] I shall pass. Thank ye kindly.
SHANSA: The price of crossing my door is blood, Captain. [the moves in front of a fire with a cauldron over it]
BARBOSSA: That explains why you're not so busy. [he looks over, seeing the skeletal remains of a man, a rat on its shoulder, sniffing at the skull]
SHANSA: Everyone pays eventually.
BARBOSSA: Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago. I saved you from the gallows, remember?
SHANSA: And I cursed your enemies. But now you come to me in fear, as the dead have taken command of the sea.
BARBOSSA: And what would the dead be wanting with me?
SHANSA: [laughs] Not you, Captain. They're searching for a Sparrow.
BARBOSSA: [seems surprised, and yet somehow, not at all] Jack? [he seems less perturbed by the mention of his old friend than he has before]
SHANSA: [takes a rat off her shoulder] Jack will sail for the Trident with a girl and a Pearl. [she holds the rodent up, looking at it closely]
BARBOSSA: The Trident can never be found.
[Shansa throws the rat into her cauldron and the flames rise. Barbossa does a slightly perturbed double-take]
SHANSA: The Trident is Jack's only hope. The dead are conquering the sea, unable to step on dry land. [In her cauldron, she and Barbossa are able to see his ships burning as the SILENT MARY sails away. Shansa looks at Barbossa] Maybe you should retire to the countryside.
BARBOSSA: [looks even more perplexed, and insulted, given his background] You mean grass? On a farm? Milkin' a cow, makin' cheese, while they sink my treasure?
SHANSA: Ask yourself this, Captain. Is this a treasure worth dying for?
BARBOSSA: I'm a pirate. Always will be. So how do I save what be mine?
SHANSA: Jack held a compass which points you to the thing you desire most. But betray the compass, and it releases your greatest fear.
BARBOSSA: A pirate's greatest fear be Salazar, is it?
[Shansa holds the compass out for him. It is unknown how or where she has it, but here it lies in her palm. She lets it go, dangling it]
BARBOSSA: How did you get this?
SHANSA: I have my ways. Lead them to Jack before he finds the Trident, and all your treasure will come back to you.
BARBOSSA: [grabs the compass] Time to make a deal with the dead.
[In the morning, back to Jack's side of the prison, far away from Shansa]
SOLDIER: Come on, pirate! [he and another soldier have Jack between them, leading him down the hall. Jack looks around, letting his weight sag so the soldiers have to work more, looking for a way out of this. He double takes at the sight of an inmate that's been singing]
JACK: Hold on -- stop! [as they stop] Dad?
[The man turns around; he is absolutely not Edward Teague. By the look on Jack's face, though, he is very familiar. Jack looks surprised, then smiles widely]
JACK: Uncle Jack!
UNCLE: Jackie boy! How's it going?
JACK: Can't complain really. You?
UNCLE: I've been waitin' all morning in here for a beating. But the service is terrible.
JACK: [shakes his head] Shameful. [His uncle moves towards the bars, and Jack struggles against the soldiers to stay in place to talk to his family a bit more]
UNCLE: Jack. The oceans have turned to blood. Best stay on dry land where it's safe.
JACK: I'm about to be executed on dry land.
UNCLE: [Uncle Jack thinks about this for a moment] Good point. Did I ever tell you the one about the skeleton?
JACK: [nods a little] Yes, you have. Many times, in fact.
UNCLE: Skeleton goes into a bar...orders a beer and a mop.
[an inmate laughs further down]
JACK: Funny as ever. [he smiles a bit and his Uncle Jack chuckles]
SOLDIER: Come on, let's go. [they force Jack along]
UNCLE: Oh, if they disembowel you, ask for Victor! He's got the softest hands!
JACK: Thank you!
UNCLE: And mention my name! They won't cut your feet off.
[a crowd clamors in St. Martin's square to watch the execution of a witch and a pirate. Carina is bodily hauled out of a cage pulled by a horse]
SOLDIER: Come on. You're up first.
[The door opens on the other, more secure prison on the first carriage led into the square, and Jack looks startled at the daylight]
SOLDIER: And how would you like to die, pirate? [Jack is escorted out] Hanging, firing squad, or a new invention: the guillotine.
JACK: Guillotine? Sounds French. I love the French. Did you know that they invented mayonnaise? How bad could it be? It's French, eh? [he's whirled around to face the guillotine and sees what it is; specifically, the sharp blade. He's being led towards it] Oh! Well. I've changed me mind! [he's shoved forward, through the crowd] No, please! Have mercy upon me! I-I'm a bed-wetter.
[Carina, meanwhile, is being led forcefully to the gallows. Henry is atop a nearby tower, looking out over the scene]
JACK: [being led up to the platform] Oh, come on. I mean, I have to walk upstairs as well for this?
SOLDIER: Bring the basket.
JACK: Basket? Why?
SOLDIER: Strap him down!
[the wood beneath Carina's feet creaks as the hangman puts a noose around her neck]
JACK: [as he's being strapped to the guillotine] Here's an idea. Here's an idea. Why don't we try a good old-fashioned stoning, eh? I'd kill to be stoned right now. Gets the crowd involved, doesn't it? [his hat is removed and he is lowered] I should like to speak to Victor in Disembowelment! I should like to speak to... [he sees the heads in the basket in front of him, eyes widening] I-I'm not one to complain normally, but this basket's full of heads.
CARINA: The final words of Carina Smyth. [the crowd jeers] Quiet! [they fall silent. She seems a bit surprised, but continues] The final words of Carina Smyth.
JACK: [sighs loudly, across the square, starting to struggle]
CARINA: Good sirs, I'm not a witch, but I forgive your common dimwittedness and feeble brains. In short, most of you have the mind of a goat.
JACK: Pardon me, sir. [he's addressing the soldier by him] Is it not common practice for those about to be executed to be granted a last, I don't know, something...
CARINA: I believe I was making a point. If you could just be patient.
JACK: No! [the crowd turns towards him] My head's about to be lopped off, hence the urgency!
CARINA: And my neck is to be broken.
JACK: Did you know that on occasion, the neck doesn't actually break? It just hurts.
CARINA: What?
JACK: Oh, yes. I've seen men swing for hours, eyes bulging, tongues swelling...revolting gurgling sound.
CARINA: May I finish?
JACK: No! You're lucky. Wish I was hung.
CARINA: Kill the filthy pirate. I'll wait.
JACK: But witches first.
CARINA: I'm not a witch. Were you not listening?
[above them, Henry swings down from the tower]
JACK: Quite hard to listen when you have the mind of a goat.
MAYOR DIX: Enough! Kill them both!
[the crowd cheers. Carina sees the executioner about to pull the lever before Henry swings by, harmlessly over the crowd, screaming. Carina sighs. Henry swings back around, tumbling to the ground and straight into a soldier. He starts fighting them off, but is quickly overpowered]
SCARFIELD: Get another noose! Did you think you could defeat us, boy?
HENRY: No, sir. I'm just the diversion. FIRE!
[on the edge of the crowd, Gibbs, Marty, Scrum, Cremble, and other crew members take the canvas off a cannon and light it. The cannon is fired straight towards the guillotine, and the executioner there lets go of the rope, the blade falling. Jack screams as the cannonball destroys the supports underneath him, swinging him around, bringing the blade closer to his neck, then back up to the top in a dangerous pendulum]
JACK: [screaming] Still rather be stoned!
[Henry punches the soldiers and moves as the crowd panics]
GIBBS: Reload!
[Scrum fights his way up to Carina as the crew fires the cannon again. He tries to jump-kick the executioner but bounces right off the man, falling on his back. Carina looks exasperated, using her boot to kick him off the platform]
SCRUM: Thank you. [he defends himself against an oncoming attack from a soldier]
[The crew and soldiers begin to fight]
SOLDIER: Come here, you pirate scum!
CREMBLE: Hey, hey! [he distracts the guard long enough for his crewmate to overpower the guard]
[Carina watches the clumsy sword fight in front of her, hearing the creaking of the boards beneath her and watching Scrum avoid the lever. The soldier tries to push the lever with his sword, and Scrum blocks it]
SCRUM: What are you doing?! No, no, no! [the two fight over the lever]
CARINA: Careful!
[Scrum overpowers the soldier and punches him off the platform. A horse cart sends Jack flying again, breaking the guillotine but leaving him strapped to the plank. He starts waddling around before the blade slams into the ground straight in front of him.
Henry is running amidst the chaos, tripping a group of soldiers, then running again]
CARINA: Thank you!
SCRUM: You're welcome, me lady. [Scrum goes to bow elegantly, sweeping his hat off...and knocks the lever, opening the boards beneath Carina's feet.
Carina screams as she drops, but Henry is there to catch her, albeit very awkwardly]
HENRY: Got you!
[Jack and a soldier he sees both scream as the soldier heads towards him, only to be intercepted by Gibbs]
JACK: Knew you'd come crawling back, traitor.
GIBBS: The Turner boy gave us ten silver pieces to save your neck! [Gibbs continues to fight, Jack using the plank he's secured to as a shield]
HENRY: [holding Carina up] From this moment on, we are to be allies. [he sways, trying not to let Carina fall completely]
CARINA: Considering where your left hand is, I'd say we're more than that.
HENRY: We find the Trident together. Do I have your word?
CARINA: You're holding everything BUT my word!
JACK: [calls out to Gibbs as a soldier struggles with the sword stuck in Jack's plank] Then I bestow upon you the honor of saving me for a small donation.
GIBBS: You expect us to pay you to save you?
JACK: [knocks the soldier out with his own sword] Yes. [he starts fending off another attacker] For a mere ten pieces. [the soldier takes the other sword and pulls it out, advancing on Jack. Jack backs up, trips backwards, and kicks the soldier in the face as he does. This frees him from his bonds, and he slowly hauls himself to his feet using the coffin he'd tripped over]
GIBBS: We won't pay more than five!
JACK: Well then...eight it is.
HENRY: [to Carina] Perhaps we could discuss this later as I'm having trouble hoisting your port!
CARINA: You are far from port. That is my stern.
HENRY: [looks confused] Are you sure?
CARINA: Positive.
SCARFIELD: [moves up to them in the chaos] Well, look at this. If I kill the coward, the witch hangs. Two for the price of one.
CARINA: Please don't let go of me.
HENRY: Might be difficult once he kills me.
[Scarfield is about to move when Jack knocks him out, laughing. He kicks the downed man, then tosses the piece of wood aside, addressing his crew and walking up to Carina and Henry]
JACK: Gentlemen, these two prisoners will lead us to the Trident.
[Aboard the DYING GULL]
GIBBS: Captain. [he approaches Jack at the helm] Do you really think we can find the Trident?
[Carina and Henry are being bound to the mast]
JACK: Master Gibbs, you old worrywart, there's nothing to be concerned about at all. What could possibly go wrong, eh?
[Gibbs raises a knowing brow at Jack]
CARINA: So this was your plan? To be tortured and killed by pirates.
HENRY: You said you needed a ship.
CARINA: You call this a ship?
JACK: Cut the shard!
[Scrum cuts a rope right by Carina's head, causing her to gasp. The DYING GULL slowly loses its supports keeping it in place]
GIBBS: Prepare to drown!
[Jack takes the helm as everyone seems surprised that the ship is actually moving. Jack looks back at the sea and chuckles]
JACK: My dear beloved crew, finally, today is-- [he's pitched onto the deck as a rope catches around the rudder and yanks the DYING GULL into its place. Everyone but Carina and Henry go flying. Jack pulls himself up] Something's gone wrong. [The rope snaps against the tension and everyone goes flying again. The DYING GULL picks up momentum and hits the sea, staying afloat]
MARTY: She floats!
[Cut to Barbossa's ship seeking out Salazar]
MURTOGG: Ship dead ahead!
[Barbossa stares at the ghost ship, one of the SILENT MARY's masts fallen and hanging in the water. Murtogg is looking through a spyglass. Mullroy plays with one of the rings on his finger]
MURTOGG: Sir. We would never question your reason as a captain, but...but is there a reason... [he clears his throat] ...as a captain, you've chosen to sail in this unreasonable direction?
BARBOSSA: [stands abruptly] Tell the men to prepare to be boarded...to stand their ground and show no fear.
[Murtogg and Mullroy look at each other, obviously showing each other fear.
The SILENT MARY bears down on them]
LESARO: Capitán, a ship sails toward us.
[Salazar chuckles, taking the helm from Lieutent Lesaro. On his ship, Barbossa strides to the bow, looking out at the nightmare before him. He sees the SILENT MARY bear down as if to ram them head on before it raises out of the water. There is nothing belowdeck. The sides of the ship open like a wooden ribcage or gaping teeth of a half-mouthed beast, ready to devour. Barbossa stares at it]
BARBOSSA: [calls out] Capitán Salazar, I hear you be looking for Jack Sparrow.
[At hearing this, Salazar pulls the helm the other direction, stopping the SILENT MARY in midair, poised to strike. Ghosts drop down aboard Barbossa's ship, intimidating the crew, although they try their best to hold their ground]
LESARO: Hold point!
[A pirate fires, but due to the nature of what the advancing conquistador is, and the fact he's missing the entire middle half of his face, the bullet passes straight through and kills his own crewmate. The conquistador turns to look at the pirate's folly.]
LESARO: And await orders.
[The confident smile drops from Barbossa's face as he hears Salazar land behind him. Something like fear shows in his face, but it could also be caution. He turns as Salazar prowls up to him, getting in his face]
BARBOSSA: My name is Captain Barbossa, and I stand before you with cordial intent.
SALAZAR: [chuckles] Cordial intent. [he turns to his crew] Do you hear that? This pirate wishes to be cordial. [he turns back to Barbossa] So let me show you what my cordiality is, hombre. Every time I tap my sword, one of your men will die. So I suggest that you speak quickly. [At receiving no response, he taps. On deck, a pirate is skewered and kicked overboard] Might want to go a bit faster, Capitán. [Two taps, two deaths] Where's Jack Sparrow?
BARBOSSA: Jack be sailing for the Trident.
SALAZAR: No, the sea belongs to the dead.
BARBOSSA: The Trident controls the sea.
SALAZAR: [whirls away, overcome with fury] No! No! There's no treasure. There's no treasure that can save him. [he raises his sword to skewer Barbossa] He will die, as will you.
BARBOSSA: [as the sword reaches his neck, he speaks] I be the only one that can lead you to him. [Salazar stares him down, trying to gauge his intent] I declare you shall have Jack's life by sunrise on the morrow...or you can take me own then. Do we have an accord?
SALAZAR: [Chuckles again. He moves closer, his sword steady at Barbossa's throat] Take me to him, and you will live to tell the tale.
BARBOSSA: You have my word. I thank ye on behalf of me crew.
[Salazar chuckles again, withdrawing his sword and tapping three times, his foot tapping with it]
SALAZAR: Well, you can take what's left of them. The living come aboard!
[Cut to the DYING GULL, which is in the sorriest shape indeed. Instead of being hoisted up, the longboat sails alongside it, bumping the hull of the ship]
JACK: Right, gentlemen.
HENRY: [still bound to the mast, he turns his head to the right] Carina, we haven't got much time. The dead are sailing straight for us.
CARINA: [looks incredulous, although Henry can't see it] Is that so?
HENRY: Yes, I've spoken to them.
CARINA: You've spoken to them? [she sounds smug] Have you spoken to krakens and mermaids as well?
HENRY: [scoffs a bit] Krakens don't speak. Everyone knows that.
CARINA: Of course. I never should have saved you.
HENRY: Last night, there was a blood moon, just as you described. Tell me what it revealed.
CARINA: And why should I trust you?
HENRY: You trusted me to hold your port, remember?
CARINA: It was my stern. Clearly, you need to spend more time at sea.
HENRY: Tell me what you found and I promise to help you.
CARINA: I don't need any help.
HENRY: Then why did you come to me, Carina? Why are we tied together in the middle of the sea, chasing the same treasure?
CARINA: [pauses] The moon revealed a clue. "To release the power of the sea, all must divide."
HENRY: Divide? What does it mean?
CARINA: I'm not sure yet.
HENRY: Then we'll find out.
JACK: [walks up to Carina with Galileo's diary, flipping through the pages] There is no map in this map.
CARINA: Give me my diary.
JACK: [folds his arms] Give me the Map No Man Can Read.
CARINA: If you could read it, then it wouldn't be called "The Map No Man Can Read." [the crew is slowly gathering around them at the bickering]
HENRY: I beg you, please, don't argue with her.
JACK: [shakes his head a bit in disbelief, trying to make his point clear] Most of the men on this ship can't read. Which makes all maps the Maps That No Man Can Read.
CARINA: Well, if you can't read it, then you have no use for it or me. [she looks smug]
JACK: Let me start again. Show me the map.
CARINA: I can't. It doesn't exist yet.
MARTY: [looks at the other crewmembers] She's a witch!
CARINA: [looks insulted] I'm an astronomer.
SCRUM: Ah! Ah, she breeds donkeys.
CARINA: What? No. An astronomer contemplates the sky.
SCRUM: Yeah, on a donkey?
CARINA: No! There's no donkey!
CREMBLE: Well, then how do you breed them?
JACK: Allow me to simplify this equation. Give me the map...or I will kill... [he spies Henry, pointing] him. I'll kill him.
[Henry turns as much as he can, looking at Jack in disbelief. Clearly, his father wasn't joking about staying away from Jack, and he's realizing that nine years too late]
CARINA: Go on then. You're bluffing.
JACK: [leans forward] And you're blushing. [he looks to the crew] Throw him over.
PIKE: [grabs Henry, starting to untie him] Come. Come on.
SCRUM: Come on.
CREMBLE: Come on. Come on.
[the pirates laugh as they shove Henry forward]
JACK: We call this keelhauling. [Carina follows Jack as he strides a few steps forward, watching his crew shove Henry to the stern] Young Henry will be tossed over, and he will be dragged under the ship.
CARINA: All right. What're you waiting for?
CREMBLE: [struggling with a resisting Henry, trying to stuff a rag in his mouth] Uh, he doesn't appear to be--
JACK: Zip, zip. Nope, not bluffing, me. He's trying to say something.
[There's muffled shouting coming from Henry as he's hoisted up]
JACK: No, no, we don't have any food aboard. Sorry.
[Henry's feet are bound together and he's tossed overboard. Carina looks horrified while Scrum leans forward excitedly]
GIBBS: [at the helm] If he's lucky, he'll drown before the barnacles shred him to ribbons.
CARINA: Barnacles?
JACK: Like a thousand knives across your back. 'Course the blood attracts sharks.
CARINA: Sharks?
GIBBS: Shark off the bow!
[the crew and Carina rush to see]
JACK: I would say that swimming is no longer his primary concern.
CARINA: [points upward] The map is there!
[everyone looks up]
JACK: Where?
MARTY: On the tip of your finger?
CARINA: No. In the heavens. That diary will lead me to a map hidden in the stars.
JACK: [looks disbelieving and shakes his head]
CARINA: Let him up. I'll find it tonight.
JACK: Sorry, can't bring him up. Look for yourself.
[Scrum pats Carina's back as she hoists her skirts and runs for the bow. Jack grins to himself]
JACK: As I said...blushing.
[Carina reaches the taffrail and looks down, panicked. Henry landed in the barely-secured longboat and is just fine, shouting around the gag in his mouth. The pirates laugh]
CARINA: [sighs, eyes rolling] Filthy pirate.
[Cut back to Saint Martin. A cloaked Shansa is being escorted through the prison, led to Scarfield]
SCARFIELD: The sea has turned to blood. A sailor washed ashore talking about the Trident. He was looking for Jack Sparrow. The same pirate who saved a witch from the gallows.
SHANSA: She's no witch. [smiling]
SCARFIELD: But you are. And you're going to help us.
SHANSA: You're afraid, Lieutenant. [she moves past him, pulling her hood back] As ships burn in the night, you want to know if you can save your own. [she steps into a cell] If the Trident is real.
SCARFIELD: You're going to read that wall for me, or you will die. The British Empire will have the Trident and rule the sea. I want to know where that pirate is going with that witch. [He and Shansa stand in Carina's cell, before the equations and stars she'd etched into the prison wall in one night]
SHANSA: Your destiny is in these stars. I will set your course.
[Cut to night on the DYING GULL. Carina draws the constellation of five stars they sail towards in Galileo's journal, now hers, in the low lantern light. She looks over, seeing Henry walk towards the stern and look out to the sea with a spyglass. Jack can be heard snoring]
JACK: [asleep sitting up, he jerks awake with a gasp] Spaghetti wolf!
HENRY: [looks at him] Why did I bother coming to you? The dead are hunting us down and you do nothing.
JACK: Nothing! You call this nothing? [he gestures with a bottle in his hand]
HENRY: You're drunk! And you're sleeping.
JACK: My point exactly! I am doing two things at once. [he stands] You can't save the unsavable, mate.
HENRY: [pacing, agitated, he sees a sword and grabs it, pointing it at him] Like it or not, Jack, you're going to help me. [he shakes the blade for emphasis] I will break my father's curse.
[the gun in Jack's hand cocks as he pulls the hammer back, below Henry's sword. Like father, like son, duped by Jack and his pistol]
JACK: Next time you raise a sword, boy, be the last to die.
[Henry puts the sword down, realizing he's lost. Jack holsters his pistol, and Henry stands at the edge of the quarterdeck, looking at Carina on the bow, her back to them]
Jack: Oh. [He's seen this before. He walks up to Henry] Might I suggest you entice her with a bit of flattery?
[Henry undoes the rope holding the helm in place]
HENRY: I'm here for my father, nothing more.
JACK: [chuckles] I knew it. Absolutely smitten with her. Now, a bit of discretion when courting a brunette...never pursue her sister. But if you cannot avoid the charm of her sister...kill the brother. Savvy?
HENRY: [does a double-take] No, I do not savvy.
JACK: [snorts] Who hurt you? By the way, that little sliver of knowledge will cost you five pieces.
HENRY: [goes up from looking at the sky, either for the map or for a reason not to throttle Jack, to looking at Jack] I'm not paying you for that.
JACK: Never say that to a woman. [shakes his head a few more times, urgently]
[Carina looks back again to see Henry looking over the side with his spyglass. She approaches, standing next to him]
CARINA: Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it's not there.
HENRY: Like the map?
CARINA: I have to find it. [she looks down at the diary and runs her thumb over it] It's the only link to who I am. Who my father was.
HENRY: So we've both spent our lives searching for our fathers. Perhaps you and I are closer than you think.
[Carina seems like she's bordering on a smile, but looks out at the waves.
On the SILENT MARY, Barbossa's crew works. Their captain holds the compass, wanting to be led to Jack, and it seems to be pointing him true. He holds the helm with a tight grip, the glow of the sun starting to illuminate the horizon]
SALAZAR: The sun is up, and so is your time. [he taps his sword, and Lesaro turns quickly.
Just as quickly, Barbossa shuts the compass and holds his neck back as a sword is pressed to it]
BARBOSSA: Not to disagree, but the precision of our accord ends at sunrise. This be but first light, far from a fully risin' sun. And I know you to be a man of honor.
SALAZAR: Honor? You know nothing of me. [he doesn't look over]
BARBOSSA: I know what it's like to be bested by Jack Sparrow. He's an enemy to us--
[Salazar whirls around, striding forcefully towards the pirate]
SALAZAR: You don't know who I am.
BARBOSSA: I've heard stories of a mighty Spanish captain, El Matador Del Mar. A man who scourged the sea, hunted and killed thousands of men.
SALAZAR: No, no, no. Men, no. No, no, no. Pirates, eh? Pirates.
[Barbossa's eyes widen slightly, realizing the mistake he's made.
Cut to a flashback of men screaming among the wreckage of the SILENT MARY, undamaged. This was Armando Salazar in his prime as cannons boom and tear ships apart]
SALAZAR: Pirates had infected the seas for generations. Taking the life of my father and his father before. So I vowed to end this plague once and for all. And that is what I did. I destroyed dozens of ships. The last ones joined together to try and defeat me! But they soon realized it was hopeless. Nothing could stop the Silent Mary.
[Cut to full flashback]
SALAZAR: [human, barking out orders as the SILENT MARY destroys ships surrounding him] Hit them below the water line. ¡Vamos! ¡Vamos!
[on one ship, a pirate yells out] Hang on, boys!
[the ship is blasted and the captain falls back, a familiar compass in his hand]
SALAZAR VOICEOVER: The sea was finally pure. Their wretched flags would no longer stain the sea.
LESARO (FLASHBACK): They are begging for mercy.
[Salazar looks down at a longboat which holds three men waving a white flag]
SALAZAR: Mercy? Mercy? There's no mercy. [he takes a bite out of his food and nods his head towards the boats, humming to himself as he moves along]
LESARO: Make ready!
[the conquistadors level their rifles as the pirates plead for help]
SALAZAR: ¡Adiós!
LESARO: Fire!
[On one of the intact ships, a pair of boots runs up to the fallen captain with the compass. This is CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN, one of the most famous pirates to ever sail the seas. He looks at the lad that ran up to him]
MORGAN: It's up to you now, Jack. [he slowly raises the compass] This compass points towards what you want most.
JACK: [in a hazy shot where his face is yet to be seen, he accepts it from his Captain's dying hand]
MORGAN: Never betray it. [he slowly falls back and passes.
The young Jack stands, holding the compass in his hand. He's young, slim, wearing a tattered waistcoat and a faded bandanna. His face is clean-shaven, and his eyes widen as he takes in everything around him: the carnage, the burning ships, and the crew, who are now looking to them as their Captain, to guide them. Jack slowly opens the compass and watches the needle swing. He follows its direction, looking up at...]
JACK: The Devil's Triangle.
SALAZAR VOICEOVER: The last of their ships were burning before my eyes. And in that moment of victory is when I heard it.
JACK: Hey! Hold on, Capitán.
[In the flashback, Salazar turns and looks through the smoke]
SALAZAR VOICEOVER: One ship was trying to escape through the smoke.
JACK: [calling out] It's a lovely day for a sail, innit?
SALAZAR VOICEOVER: And there, in the crow's nest, there was this young pirate boy.
JACK: The way I see it, there's just the two of us left. You surrender to me now and I'll let you live. Simple.
SALAZAR VOICEOVER: He stood there looking like a little bird, eh? And from that day, he earned himself a name that would haunt me for the rest of my days...Jack the Sparrow.
JACK: [as Salazar looks at him through a spyglass] Right then! You surrender too me now and I let you live. [he points at Salazar, hanging off the rigging, and gestures grandly] I shall let you live! [he laughs, grabbing a line and sliding back down to deck. As he does, the colors of the ship are hoisted]
SALAZAR VOICEOVER: This boy was mocking my power, so I chased him, knowing that I would run my knife along his neck. And when he was dead, I would finish finally with the pirate's life!
[The alive Salazar rushes to the railing, barking out orders as Jack's ship sails towards the Triangle]
SALAZAR: Follow him in.
JACK: To the gallows! Grab some lines! [he holds the helm, confidently] Prepare the bootleg! Portside. [the crew rushes to obey him, and Jack looks behind him quickly at the gaining SILENT MARY] Throw it now! [he puts his entire being into spinning the helm. The ropes tossed catch on a few nearby rocks, and the line slowly runs until its taut. What would one day be the BLACK PEARL starts to bank quickly and sharply, a maneuver impossible by any other means. Jack lets the helm go, then grabs it to steady the ship as cargo and crew alike are tossed about. The SILENT MARY cannot stop its trajectory, cannot turn on a dime, as Jack's ship is hauled about quickly, leaving Salazar trapped]
SALAZAR: Bootleg turn. [he moves to the helm quickly, trying to follow. He looks to the side, then does a double-take. He sees the crew staring at him, grim-faced, but most importantly, he sees Jack the Sparrow. He walks, swinging the cord of the compass, spinning it around as he meets Salazar's eyes with the tiniest of smirks. He then turns away. The SILENT MARY rams into the shallow rocks of the Triangle, which rip open its decks. He and his men are thrown forward. A powder keg ignites and the ship explodes, and as it sails into oblivion and they die...
...they are trapped as ghosts in the form in which they were at the exact moment of the explosion. Salazar tumbles overboard.
Jack watches from his ship, holding the rigging. He steps back, at the head of the quarterdeck stairs. A crewmember clears his throat]
JACK: What's all this?
[the pirate lays the bandolier and sword down on deck reverently] Tribute, sir.
[Jack looks startled as more crew members start to file forward with what they have. All effects Jack has been insistent on keeping throughout the movies: a sash of cream and red; a narwhal tooth that now hangs from his bandana; chain of bones and beads; a faded tricorn hat, right from a man's head. Jack chuckles and gives small "oohs!" of appreciation]
(TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: We know Morgan and Bartholomew set forth the Code which Jack's father guards, and while old, Morgan should be long dead. It's likely he's been using the Fountain of Youth from the previous movie, or some other legend, to stay alive. We also know from a line in Dead Man's Chest that Jack got the compass bartering from Tia Dalma. The writers obviously forgot both of these points, but it's also possible that Jack had the compass taken, not willingly given, and it ended up with Tia Dalma. He would do absolutely anything to get it back, given this flashback. We also see briefly that the name of the ship Jack is sailing is the WICKED WENCH, an homage to the book The Price of Freedom, which explored Jack's background with the East India Trading Company and Cutler Beckett, but has no real relation, since the two backstories cancel each other out. A nice Easter Egg though.)
SALAZAR: He took everything from me...and filled me with rage. And pain. And here is where the tale ends. [In present day, Salazar moves up, behind Barbossa, and pulls his sword back to run the man through. Barbossa has been wide-eyed at the tale, again realizing exactly how foolish it was to make a deal with this man]
BARBOSSA: Not yet, Capitán. There! [he points] Found as promised.
[Salazar holds the sword, looking over Barbossa's shoulder at the small ship in the sunrise. He lowers it, slowly.
As the sun rises higher, Carina furiously jots down notes with her pen and chronometer. Henry takes an old necklace out from beneath his shirt and plays with it; Will's necklace. Carina looks over, and Henry sees her looking. She goes back to her notebook]
GIBBS: So she's saying she's got the map, but she's the only one who can follow it?
CREMBLE: So we should shoot her?
HENRY: Leave her be. She will take us to the Trident.
GIBBS: You've been saying that for hours.
SCRUM: Two things we know are true, eh? [he points up] Stars don't shine by day. AND she forgot the donkey.
[Carina closes her eyes briefly in exasperation]
GIBBS: [to Jack, who's been gnawing thoughtfully on the tip of his thumb this entire time] How can we go to a spot where no land exists on any map?
CARINA: [looks at them, taking the instrument she's been using and showing them] This chronometer keeps the exact time in London. [the others look confused as she continues] I'm using it to make an altitude measurement to determine longitude. Only then will we find our exact spot at sea.
PIRATE: So you expect to find the Trident with a timepiece?
CARINA: Yes. My calculations are precise and true. I'm not only an astronomer, I'm also a horologist.
[the men gasp. Some look flummoxed, others look far more interested, and yet others aroused. She gets a LOT of stares as they at least try to be polite]
JACK: No shame in that, dear. I mean, we all have to earn a living, eh?
GIBBS: Oh. Yeah.
CARINA: [realizing what they think, she looks around] No. No, I'm a horologist.
SCRUM: So was my mum. But she didn't crow about it as loud as you.
CARINA: Are you saying your mother was academically inclined?
JACK: [smirks] More like horizontally reclined. [Scrum motions to him with a smile and a "see?" gesture]
CARINA: Horology is the study of time! [she holds up the chronometer]
SCRUM: And she was always looking at her watch.
MARTY: I can vouch for that.
[the crew turns and stares at him]
JACK: So no one can find the "X" but you, right?
CARINA: No.
[Gibbs, getting bored of these circles, starts gazing out to sea. His eyes catch something and widen]
SCRUM: And the donkey?
GIBBS: Ship to the aft!
[Jack jumps as Gibbs shouts that all but right in his ear. They all look]
HENRY: Salazar. Jack, the dead will not rest until they get their revenge.
GIBBS: Dead? [the crew looks shocked] No, no. The dead were never part of this deal.
PIRATE: We never should have followed a luckless pirate and a witch to the sea.
CREMBLE: Right, that's it. Kill 'em all. [he withdraws his pistol and points it at Jack's head. The crew follows suit, pointing weapons at Henry and Carina as well]
JACK: Kill me and I'll be dead. And then the other dead won't be able to have their revenge against me. [he moves towards Henry and Carina] ...being dead.
CREMBLE: What?
HENRY: Which will anger them even more. He's right.
JACK: That's right.
CARINA: Are all pirates this stupid?
JACK: [after a beat] Yes.
SCRUM: Yeah.
MARTY: Yeah.
GIBBS: What are we going to do?
JACK: As captain, might I suggest...
[cut to Jack, Henry, and Carina in a longboat]
CARINA: Mutiny? You had to suggest a mutiny?
HENRY: Carina, the dead are coming.
CARINA: Well, I choose not to believe in supernatural nonsense.
HENRY: [rowing] Do you not see what's behind us?
[Carina turns around to see the SILENT MARY. Aboard it, Salazar looks at them through a spyglass, then turns around. He nods to Lesaro]
LESARO: Drop them. Drop them.
[crewmembers hurry belowdeck to the one deck that still exists, showing the rotting corpse of a shark.
Back on the longboat, Carina stands, undoing her dress]
HENRY: What are you doing?
CARINA: The men on that ship are looking for Jack, and Jack is on this boat. So I'm going to swim for it.
JACK: How DARE you do exactly what I would do if I were you.
HENRY: Carina, stop that.
JACK: [seeing Carina in her corset and shift] No, no, no. Don't stop that.
HENRY: This has gone far enough.
JACK: No, it has not. Listen not to him. Carry on. Carry on.
[Carina gives Jack an annoyed look and steps past Henry, jumping into the water]
JACK: Why? She was almost finished.
HENRY: I saw her ankles. [grinning a little]
JACK: You'd have seen a lot more if you'd kept your cakehole shut.
[On the SILENT MARY, conquistadors haul the dead sharks along. Salazar watches them through holes in the deck. They are dumped out of the holes made from the explosion into the sea]
SALAZAR: Kill the Sparrow.
[A shark's eye goes from glassy to black. Its jaw snaps shut and it twitches, starting to swim. The others follow]
MULLROY: Oh, that's not good, is it?
JACK: [in the longboat] Keep rowing, man. Faster. Faster.
HENRY: [he takes the oars out and dumps them in the boat] No. That's it. I'm going with her. [he stands, undoing his coat]
JACK: [stands] You would leave me for some horologist in her knickers?
HENRY: Yes.
JACK: [gasps, eyes wide] You men are all alike.
HENRY: [looks at him, puzzled, ready to jump before an undead shark snaps at him. He screams, falling back into the boat and onto Jack.
Another shark comes up behind them and starts chomping at the longboat]
Jack: Shark. [they both get up, seeing fins circling. Henry picks up an oar. When a hammerhead takes a bite out of the boat, he smacks at it furiously, heaving it off.
The hammerhead goes into the water, but keeps ahold of the oar. Henry struggles with it, causing the longboat to rock dangerously. It dislodges itself, but Henry loses balance, yelping before he hits the water]
JACK: Henry! [he reaches down and helps the young man back into the longboat. A shark jumps up where he just was, missing him and Jack by inches, flying through the air over their heads and snapping before hitting the water again.
Carina makes it to shore. Meanwhile, Henry and Jack are trying to bail the sinking longboat]
HENRY: It doesn't seem to be working!
JACK: No, we'll be fine. We'll be fine.
[Aboard the SILENT MARY, the conquistadors yell. Salazar holds his sword up]
SALAZAR: ¡Vamos!
[he and the men drop onto the surface of the water and start to run. Jack sees this from the longboat and looks back at Henry]
JACK: How do they do that?
HENRY: We have to swim for it. I'll distract them. [he grabs Carina's discarded dress and throws it into the water, attracting the sharks] Now! [he leaps over the side]
JACK: [goes to follow, but his foot goes through a loose board, stuck in the water feet away from the fighting sharks. He struggles, sitting back and looking at the hoard of dead that are coming for him. He picks up a four-pronged hook and flails at the nearest shark that comes up, screaming and beating at it] Oh, shoo! Go away! [he tosses the hook into its mouth as it falls back into the water. Seeing Henry, the shark starts to pursue him, the line being pulled with it. Seeing this, Jack quickly ties it to the longboat as Salazar bears down on him, feet away. Right as the Capitán swings, Jack ducks, the line goes taut, and the boat takes off with help from the shark] Henry! [Jack holds on to the line, laughing. He pulls up, hard, saving Henry from a fatal bite. Henry looks over and Jack bodily hauls him into the boat.
The shark makes a sharp turn as land approaches, and both men scream as the boat is flung from the force, and they along with it. They hit the sand and the boat shatters into splinters.
Carina looks up from where she was resting in the sand, seeing an army of ghosts running atop water, screaming at the top of their lungs. All three gasp as Salazar approaches]
SALAZAR: Hi, Jack Sparrow. [he chuckles] Jack the Sparrow.
JACK: You're Spanish? [he looks over as one of Salazar's crew screams, his foot having hit dry land. He starts to go up in smoke, and crumbles into dust]
CARINA: [stammers] You're ghosts!
JACK: Oh. They're unable to step on land. [he laughs, getting to his feet] I knew that, though.
CARINA: [scrambles to her feet, screaming] Ghosts! [she screams and runs inland]
HENRY: Carina!
SALAZAR: You will soon pay for what you did to me.
JACK: No, no, no. There's no need to bother, really.
HENRY: [starts to chase the upset young woman] Carina!
JACK: I have to time to chat because me map's just run away.
SALAZAR: I will be waiting for you!
JACK: [scurries further inland] Why would you be waiting for me? Why would he be waiting for me?
[Carina crashes through the jungle foliage, panicked. She's caught in a net trap, screaming.
A naval ship catches sight of the DYING GULL. A sailor pulls his spyglass away to call to Scarfield]
Pirates!
[Scarfield looks up.
Gibbs, wearing a more elaborate tricorn hat, is looking at the navy ship through his own spyglass. He gasps, collapsing it]
GIBBS: Scrum.
SCRUM: Captain.
GIBBS: Jack always told me that if anything should ever happen to him, he wanted YOU to be captain. [he taps Scrum's chest]
SCRUM: Yeah, but the men voted for you. That's why you got a captain's hat.
GIBBS: Be that as it may, them were his wishes, so be a good lad and take the wheel. [he takes Scrum's hat off and deposits the one from his head on Scrum's] And, uh, you take the captain's hat.
SCRUM: [beaming] Oh. [he chuckles] This is the proudest moment of my--
[cut to Scrum getting beaten by marines]
SCARFIELD: We will beat your captain to death until he reveals where they're heading.
[Gibbs looks like he feels bad, but not quite bad enough to be in Scrum's place.
Back to the jungle]
HENRY: Carina!
JACK: I know what's ailing you, boy. You've got the unscratchable itch.
HENRY: Carina is the only one who can help us find the Trident. And I'm not in love with her.
JACK: Love? [puzzled] Who said anything about love? What are you talking about?
HENRY: The unscratchable itch?
JACK: Scabies. I'm talking about scabies. [Henry looks at him, confused] Small mites that burrow under the skin. It's certainly been ailing me, has been for years. Oh, no.
[They both stop, coming to a sign that says "HANGMAN'S BAY: STRANGERS NOT WELCOME" with two cages on the side that hold skeletons]
CARINA: Help! Help me!
HENRY: [running through the brush] Carina!
CARINA: Help! Henry, help me!
JACK: Help her!
[JACK AND HENRY are caught up in their own net]
SALAZAR: By rule of the King, I sentence you all to death! [he has Barbossa and his crew ready to be executed on the SILENT MARY. They are hanging upside down, helpless]
MULLROY: I think we should tell each other where our treasures are buried, just in case one of us survives.
MURTOGG: Oh, good idea.
MULLROY: You go first.
MURTOGG: My treasure is buried between two crossed palm trees in an unmarked grave in Aruba. What about yours?
MULLROY: I haven't got any.
SALAZAR: You promised me Jack's blood!
BARBOSSA: But Jack be trapped! He can never escape that island.
SALAZAR: [gets in Barbossa's face, screaming] He's on land!
[On the island, Henry grunts, struggling in the net as some men below come to investigate the noise. Jack looks down]
JACK: Hello.
[two of the three men chuckle, and the other one knocks Jack out with a quick blow. Back on the SILENT MARY, Barbossa is furiously negotiating for his life]
BARBOSSA: I upheld our deal. Me men and meself will go ashore. [he sees Salazar skewer another crewmember] The scurvy traitor will be yours on me honor. [he puts a hand over his chest]
SALAZAR: Honor? What honor, hombre? What honor?! You don't know what honor is!
BARBOSSA: Spare me my life, and I'll fetch you the Sparrow. [He speaks some Spanish, then reverts back to English] An accord?
[Salazar, seeing that he has no real choice, cuts Barbossa down with fury.
Part of Hangman's Bay is built in a skeleton of a creature long dead. It's near a rocky shore, and this is where Jack awakens, slowly]
MAN: [voice echoes] Wake up, Sparrow.
[Jack comes to, seeing people he doesn't recognize sitting in rows. He looks around, seeing the ribs and spine of a creature form a sort of building around them. There's a rope around his neck, and he's being held up until he can stand on his own]
MAN: Wake up, Sparrow.
[He looks over and sees Henry and Carina, the latter who has been put in a pink dress, both tied up and sitting in the front row, looking displeased]
MAN: Wake up, Sparrow. It's time to pay your debt.
JACK: Pig...Pig Kelly? [he chuckles nervously] Me old mate.
KELLY: Mate? [snorts, calling to the others] You hear that, boys? This lyin' pirate owes me a plunder of silver and luck has brought him to Hangman's Bay...where he can settle his debt here and now.
JACK: Oh, and I will. I will, Pig. Name your price.
KELLY: Her name is Beatrice. [he motions out to a woman in a white dress standing down the makeshift aisle] And she's my poor, widowed sister.
[BEATRICE is a large woman being fitted into a white wedding dress. Her pallor looks almost purple from this distance, her matted gold hair done up in curls the best it can be. Jack does a double take and whimpers]
JACK: What is that?
KELLY: She's been looking for a respectable man. But you'll have to do.
BEATRICE: [flaps a hand with her makeshift bouquet, calling up] Louis, let's get on with this.
JACK: No! Why? Why would we do that?
KELLY: To make an honest woman of her, Jack. Congratulations. It's your wedding day.
[Jack shakes his head rapidly]
PRIEST: Let us begin.
BEATRICE: We'll honeymoon in the barn.
[Jack yells and turns it into a chuckle. He tries to walk away, but the noose keeps him from doing so, and his hands are bound behind his back. He chokes, falling back, and groans. A fiddle creaks out a wedding song]
JACK: No, no, no. Now, Pig, how could I honestly make an honest woman out of it? That...her. I mean, her.
[BEATRICE approaches, and her pallor is indeed blue to purple. The dress is ragged. Two children appear at her sides]
JACK: [whimpers] What are those things?
BEATRICE: Our children. Best not look them in the eye.
KELLY: Bring the best man and the bridesmaid. [Jack chuckles, then jerks his head away]
JACK: [whispering] I looked it in the eye.
[Henry and Carina are escorted up front]
PRIEST: Place your hand on the Bible.
JACK: [desperate, he blurts out] I've got scabies.
[On a close up, we see Beatrice's lips are chapped and mottled. There are growths on her face, and sickly yellow circles under her eyes]
BEATRICE: So do I.
JACK: Ugh! [he looks like he's trying not to vomit]
PRIEST: Place your hand on the Bible.
JACK: [looks up, then declares] I'm a bed-wetter.
KELLY: [aims a pistol at him; Henry and Carina look alarmed] Say "I do" or I'll put a bullet in your skull.
HENRY: Jack, they're going to kill us!
JACK: [turns to him] I don't care!
CARINA: Just say "I do."
KELLY: Last chance, Jack.
HENRY: Wait! Surely, this is not legal. [he looks at Carina]
JACK: [seizing that, he runs with it] This is not legal.
CARINA: He's right.
KELLY: [lowers the gun]
CARINA: Does any man here object to these nuptials?
JACK: I do. [he gasps, and Carina looks horrified]
PRIEST: Congratulations! You may kiss the bride!
JACK: [gasps again. The crowd applauds and Beatrice licks her lips. She spits to the side and sniffs, wiping snot from her nose on her hand. She puckers her lips in a very unattractive manner] No. ...you like seafood, do you? [he can smell her breath]
BEATRICE: Come on!
JACK: [yells in fright]
[there's a gunshot, startling everyone. Jack looks down the aisle. Barbossa stands at the end of the aisle with what remains of his crew, including Murtogg and Mullroy]
BARBOSSA: Jack, we meet again.
JACK: Hector! [he turns to the others] This is me bestest mate in the whole world.
BARBOSSA: [striding forward, clearly enjoying this] I always knew you'd settle down eventually.
JACK: [his face drops] Did you bring me a gift?
[Barbossa shoots Pig Kelly, and everyone screams and scatters]
JACK: That'll do. [as Barbossa approaches] You look marvelous. Got quite the spring in your step. Has your leg grown back?
MULLROY: Uh, Captain, shouldn't we be getting back to Salazar...trade Mr. Sparrow's life in for our own?
[Jack eyes Barbossa with distrust and a fair bit of that old disdain]
BARBOSSA: Aye, that we could...but I've come for the Trident of Poseidon.
MURTOGG: You're gonna double-cross the dead?
MULLROY: You did promise.
BARBOSSA: And with it, I'll gut the dead that stole my command of the sea.
JACK: As much as I love this plan, no vessel can outrun that wretched hull of a ship.
BARBOSSA: But there be one, Jack. [Barbossa unsheathes the sword he took from BLACKBEARD in the previous movie] The fastest ship I know, the Pearl... [he taps Jack's chest, where he seems to know Jack keeps the PEARL in a bottle] ...trapped in that bottle by Blackbeard five winters ago. [he holds the sword up] By the power of that blackguard's sovereign blade, I hereby release the Black Pearl to her former and rightful glory. [he stabs Jack's chest, and Jack screams in alarm, but the blade merely pierces the bottle]
[cut to a shot of Jack and the new crew running along the beach, Jack with the bottle held out in front of him, looking at his ship]
JACK: Get ready! Get ready for it! It's coming! It's coming! [he runs along some rocks] It's coming, it's coming! [he sounds like a giddy child, but stumbles and the bottle drops, smashing on the rocks. The BLACK PEARL immediately springs up, starting to grow in size, rather rapidly] Stand aside! Stand aside! [he backs up, motioning everyone else away] It's coming! [the PEARL continues to grow. Jack leans down, picking up the PEARL in two hands, looking downtrodden] It's shrunken. Why doesn't it unshrink? Maybe it's cold, huh?
BARBOSSA: [swaggers up, exasperated] She needs the sea. [he grabs the ship from Jack's hands and moves along the rocks. Jack makes a face at him. Barbossa heaves it out with all his strength, and the BLACK PEARL lands in the ocean, sinking. He waits, expression falling]
JACK: [his entire face falls. He sighs heavily] She was a fine ship...
[There's a moment of silence, then water bubbling. Slowly, the BLACK PEARL rises from the water in her former glory. Jack grins widely and Barbossa bursts into joyous laughter]
JACK: Let-- [the sound of a gun cocking interrupts him as Barbossa holds an elegant pistol to his head]
BARBOSSA: There be room for only one captain. [JACK THE MONKEY climbs up on Barbossa's shoulder, still affected by Cortez's curse and therefore, unaged]
JACK: [turns, startling back as he usually does at the sight of the monkey] Ooh! [he shakes his head a bit] Filthy beast.
BARBOSSA: Time to race the dead.
[Cut to on board the BLACK PEARL]
JACK: The only safe place is the land. [he's being tied to the mast] Why are we going away from the land? Anyone?
CARINA: Captain, your map is incomplete. I can take us to the Trident if you'd only trust me. [she stands on the quarterdeck, she and Henry tied up again]
JACK: [from the bow] ANYONE?
CARINA: Did you not hear anything I just said?
BARBOSSA: So you be saying that star is pretendin' to be a map?
MURTOGG: Sir, there is no island on any map to support what the woman says.
[Carina blows out a breath of frustration and Barbossa looks at his charts]
HENRY: Captain, you don't have to understand her. Just believe her.
JACK: Anyone?
[Thunder rumbles in the distance; the Navy's ship is not far off. In the brig, Cremble rams himself against the bars]
GIBBS: If we had something sharp, I could pick that lock.
MARTY: You're not going to find anything that sharp here.
[Gibbs looks over at Scrum, who's being attended to after his beatdown. Cut to Scrum screaming as Gibbs tries to get ahold of his filthy, sharp toenail]
GIBBS: Keep still, you bilge rat. [corrects himself] Captain!
SCRUM: [being held down by the crew] No, please! I don't wanna be captain anymore! [Gibbs pulls at the toenail]
[on the PEARL, Barbossa strides to the taffrail in the night, looking over the side. He sees thunder in the distance, then looks over]
BARBOSSA: Release 'em!
[The crew starts to untie Henry and Carina]
MULLROY: Sir, you wouldn't allow a woman to steer your ship?
BARBOSSA: She will follow her star, or we'll all die together.
[Carina strides up to the helm and Mullroy looks over her before sighing and relinquishing his hold. Carina takes the helm.
Gibbs and company are in a longboat, rowing away in the storm. He looks away after some glaring from Scrum and spot something]
GIBBS: The Black Pearl! She sails again! [as the men cheer] Come on, lads!
CARINA: [speaks to Henry as he looks though his spyglass] This ship, those ghosts...there can be no logical explanation.
HENRY: The myths of the sea are real, Carina. I'm glad you can finally see you were wrong.
CARINA: Wrong? Perhaps I had some doubts.
HENRY: [looks over, half-smiling in his disbelief] That is the worst apology I've heard.
CARINA: Apology? Why would I apologize?
HENRY: Because we've been chased by the dead, sailing on a ship raised from a bottle. Where is your science in that?
CARINA: Fine, then I will apologize.
HENRY: [collapses the spyglass] Go on, then.
CARINA: Although one could argue that you owe ME an apology, as my life has been threatened by pirates and dead men.
HENRY: Which you now believe in, sorry to say.
CARINA: Apology accepted. [she smiles a bit]
HENRY: [looks dumbfounded] I'm going to the lookout. [he storms away]
CARINA: I'm glad you see it my way. [she smirks to herself]
[on the Navy's ship]
MARINE: Twelve degrees to port! Ready the guns.
MARINE 2: Aye!
SCARFIELD: Those pirates are going for the Trident.
[On the BLACK PEARL
Carina is still at the helm. Barbossa walks up to her, Jack the Monkey on his shoulder. Carina flips through Galileo's -- her -- diary. Barbossa sees it]
BARBSOSA: Where did you get that from, missy?
CARINA: [snaps it shut and holds it to her]
BAROSSA: I know this book. Stolen from an Italian ship many years ago.
CARINA: Stolen? No, you're mistaken.
BARBOSSA: There was a ruby on the cover I would not soon forget.
CARINA: [holds the book out, looking at the spot where the ruby once was] This was given to me by my father, who was clearly a man of science. [she reaches into her dress and pulls out the ruby as proof]
[Jack the Monkey grabs it and chitters, skittering away. Barbossa grabs the helm to block a shocked and offended Carina who was going after the escaping monkey]
BARBOSSA: He was clearly a common thief.
CARINA: [slaps him, hard] The memory of my father will not be defiled by the tongue of a pirate! [Barbossa smirks to himself] This diary is my birthright. Left to me on the steps of a children's home, along with a name and nothing else.
BARBOSSA: Oh, so you're an orphan. What be you called?
CARINA: Brightest star in the North gave me my name. [she rubs over the constellations on the diary with her thumb]
BARBOSSA: That would be Carina.
CARINA: Carina Smyth. [Barbossa looks at her in shock] So you do know your stars.
BARBOSSA: I'm a captain. [He starts walking away from the helm] I know which stars to follow home. [Barbossa, clearly shaken, uses his cane to help him descend the quarterdeck stairs. From his place tied to the mast, Jack cranes his head around curiously. Barbossa makes his way towards the bow of the ship, breathing heavily. He holds up the compass and opens it slowly, looking to where the needle points, following it, gazing at Carina]
JACK: Smyth. [Barbossa turns to look up at his old friend] Smyth is quite an unusual name. Did we not once know someone called Smyth?
BARBOSSA: [hurries up so Jack stops calling out] Shut your trap.
JACK: What was her name? It's right on the tip of me tongue. [he sticks it out] Oh!
BARBOSSA: [holds a blade to his throat as Jack retracts his tongue] Do you wanna lose that tongue?
JACK: Margaret Smyth. [He chuckles]
BARBOSSA: Aye.
JACK: Should we make an accord, then? Or shall I tell you-know-who what we both know to be true?
BARBOSSA: We both take this secret to our graves.
JACK: [looks shocked] You mean it is true? I was bluffing.
BARBOSSA: I'm not.
JACK: You kill me, you got nothing to bargain the dead with. So you need me. [Barbossa lowers the sword, looking frustrated at being bested by Jack yet again and a little lost at the recent turn of events] I'll have to be frank, Hector: You are very, very ugly. [Barbossa turns back towards him, annoyance winning out] So how could you produce a fetching creature such as that?
BARBOSSA: [keeps turning back towards Jack, then away, finally spitting out] Margaret died. I summoned as much honor as a worthless blackguard ever could. I placed the infant in an orphanage, never to see her again. I thought the ruby might afford her some ease in life...but I never imagined she'd take those scribblings and make a life of her own. A life that's led her back to me. [Jack the Monkey hops back up on Barbossa's shoulder]
JACK: I'd say this puts me in a rather favorable position, Daddy.
BARBOSSA: [approaches him] You tell me what you want.
JACK: I want me compass. 216 barrels of rum. And the monkey.
[Jack the Monkey screeches]
BARBOSSA: You want Jack?
JACK: Dinner. I want to eat him. I want to eat that monkey--
BARBOSSA: [stuffs a cloth in his mouth] No deal, Jack. A clever young woman such as that would never believe that a swine like me could ever be her blood.
[Jack speaks through the makeshift gag, incoherent, as Barbossa starts to walk away. He pauses]
BARBOSSA: And the Trident will be mine. [He continues on.]
HENRY: [Stands in the crow's nest with his spyglass as the wind howls around him. He thinks he sees something and looks through the spyglass, calling to the crew below] Redcoats! Redcoats!
SCARFIELD: Prepare to fire!
OFFICER: Prepare to fire! Man that gun!
[Carina looks at the ship, fear on her face]
BARBOSSA: She comes starboard. We shall fight to the last. [He swaggers back up to the quarterdeck] The Pearl will not be taken from me again.
OFFICER: [approaches Scarfield on deck] Sir.
SCARFIELD: [looks through his spyglass at the BLACK PEARL, then collapses it] Only the British Empire will hold the power of the sea.
[There's a loud rumbling and creaking behind him. In the lightning flashes, a ship is revealed, bearing down on the Navy's ship. It is the SILENT MARY. Scarfield looks up in horror as the ship raises, revealing its skeletal underbelly moments before the entire ship is devoured, the powder keg setting it aflame. Salazar is at the helm, making straight for the PEARL]
BARBOSSA: [to Carina] Whatever happens, stay your course!
[Jack hops up and down, screaming muffled against the gag in his mouth. The SILENT MARY slides right up next to the BLACK PEARL, scraping against it, sending men flying. The entire ship rocks, and Carina struggles to keep them on course. Salazar's men board]
SALAZAR: [sing-songy] Jack Sparrow! Jack Sparrow.
[Henry climbs down from the rigging, seeing Salazar and grabbing something from the deck, staying out of sight]
SALAZAR: I've come with a butcher's bill.
[Henry runs up to Jack, who gives a muffled scream. The young Turner stars furiously sawing at the ropes with a dagger as Salazar approaches Murtogg]
SALAZAR: Where is he? [Murtogg, whimpering, points to the bow, Mullroy behind him. Salazar turns away, both looking relieved]
BARBOSSA: Defend yourselves, men! To the death!
[Fighting ensues on the Pearl. Salazar strides single-mindedly towards Jack. Up on the bow, Jack has his gag out as Henry furiously works to saw through the thick ropes]
JACK: Hurry up, man. What did you sharpen it with? Butter?
[Salazar approaches, anticipation on his face, only to see a pile of rope in Jack's place. He looks up, seeing Jack grab a line and swing out, towards the SILENT MARY, only to come back towards the BLACK PEARL with a yelp. He slams into a cannon on the SILENT MARY and groans, stunned. Salazar jumps down, landing on the cannon, and Jack gasps]
SALAZAR: There's nowhere to hide. [he swings down, but Jack jumps, over to the PEARL's cannons]
[The two start a cannon-hopping duel between the ships as Marty, Gibbs, Scrum, and the rest climb aboard the BLACK PEARL on the other side, into the chaos]
GIBBS: Let's be brave. Save the Pearl! [he grabs a sword, yelling, moving to the chaos]
CARINA: [flipping through the diary pages furiously] This has to be it. [she looks up at the constellation] It has to be here.
BARBOSSA: Find that land! Or we'll all die!
CARINA: [calls down] We're nearly there! I-It's here somewhere!
[The BLACK PEARL moves away from the SILENT MARY, only for the ghost ship to swing back in. Jack, holding a cannon, looks as the figurehead of the SILENT MARY actually moves, turning to look at him. It does not only that; it moves its entire body, holding its spear up in preparation to strike]
JACK: Oh! [he bolts, hopping between cannons again as the figurehead comes loose and chases him. He's stopped by Salazar in front of him, and topples to a cannon below, then another one, landing on it in a rather painful position] Ow. [he looks up to see a member of Salazar's crew aiming a cannon at him, the fuse lit. As the ships coast together, he backs up against the wood of the PEARL, whimpering. The cannon presses against his cheek, then moves away as the ships sway. As the figurehead moves to strike, Jack hops to the SILENT MARY, grabbing a line that forces the cannon up, and it fires on its own figurehead. Jack laughs briefly before seeing Salazar and goes back to cannon-hopping. He finds himself caught between the headless figurehead and Salazar before the rocking of the ship causes a cannon to knock him straight through the wood, into the SILENT MARY]
MULLROY: [fighting off what he can with Murtogg as Henry scrambles around deck] Have you found what you're looking for yet, miss?!
CARINA: I'm trying! [she looks up, horrified] The stars will soon be gone.
[In fighting, Barbossa takes a cut to the arm.
On the SILENT MARY, Jack carefully makes his way through until Salazar appears in front of him. Jack yelps and the two fight, Salazar knocking him down.
On the BLACK PEARL, Carina looks at a small strip of land, hope shining through on her face. Henry clumsily parries]
HENRY: Carina!
CARINA: Henry, look! The island is there!
HENRY: [looks back, then up at her with a smile] You found it!
[On the SILENT MARY, Jack defends himself the best he can lying down, but he's soon disarmed. Salazar, relishing the moment, pulls his sword back, but Jack spots something behind him]
JACK: The island.
[Salazar's head whips around, horrified]
LESARO: Land. [he carefully turns the helm away]
GHOST PIRATE: Get to the Mary! [he and the other crewmembers move]
[Salazar looks back down, but Jack is gone. He's hopping back aboard the PEARL. Salazar moves, getting aboard the PEARL and grabbing the helm with Carina, trying to move the ship. Carina does not let go, terrified but determined. Henry bolts up the stairs]
HENRY: Carina! [he yelps as he's thrown back.
The BLACK PEARL runs aground on the island, and everyone is thrown forward. Salazar sees some of his men vanishing and grabs Henry, jumping back over to the SILENT MARY]
HENRY: Carina!
CARINA: [reaches for him] Henry! [as the ship slows, then stops, she rushes to the taffrail, then looks back] They took Henry!
BARBOSSA: The Trident be all that can save him now.
CARINA: [looks at the crew, who groan, slowly getting up] Then we have to find it. [She walks quickly, looking at the barren strip of land. The rest of the crew pushes themselves to their feet and move to the taffrail, looking at it as well. Carina opens her diary] Where is it? [she flips through the pages] It has to be here.
[As the sun rises, all look up, seeing how it illuminates crystals on the island. They murmur in surprise; the barren strip of land now looks like the night sky, full of stars]
CARINA: [moves next to Jack in awe] Look at it, Jack. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is what my father wanted me to find. [she looks at the diary]
JACK: The rocks?
CARINA: No, not rocks. Stars. This is the Map No Man Can Read. This island is a perfect reflection of the heavens! [she looks out, noticing red dots in a significant pattern; the constellation motif. Where the final star should be is nothing] One star's missing. Quickly!
[Jack looks dumbfounded, tossing his hands up and following her]
CARINA: We have to find the Trident to save Henry.
JACK: Hector, I think you should know, she's a horologist. [he rushes off as Barbossa whirls around]
[Carina leads the way across the land, Jack and Barbossa following. She approaches where the final "star" should be, and runs her hands over the jagged red stone]
CARINA: Why isn't it glowing?
BARBOSSA: [holds out the ruby from Galileo's Diary] Finish it, Carina.
CARINA: [looks at him for a moment, then takes the gem out of his palm, looking it over] The missing star. For my father.
BARBOSSA: [nods a little] Aye. Do it for him.
[Carina carefully sets the gem back on top, where it had been broken off, and a red light shoots from it, creating the constellation of five stars on the diary. The ground rumbles. Behind them, the ocean slowly parts, going all the way to the ocean floor. The ground under Jack and Carina gives way, and they slide down the slope created, screaming. Barbossa looks down, eyes wide. After a long tumble, Carina and Jack hit the bottom, and slowly get up, looking at how the sea has completely divided. As Carina walks forward, Jack snatches Galileo's Diary]
CARINA: Look.
JACK: Poseidon's Tomb.
CARINA: This way. [she hurries forward, and Jack follows]
[Aboard the SILENT MARY]
LESARO: Capitán, you know the danger. Don't do it.
CREWMEMBER: He has no choice. Jack is on land going for the Trident.
LESARO: Capitán, there must be another way. [Salazar turns from looking at the dazed Henry to his Lieutenant] Once you possess the living, there's no coming back. You will be trapped in his body forever.
SALAZAR: The Trident will set me free. Time to kill a Sparrow.
HENRY: [struggling against the sword held to his neck] No!
[On the sea floor, Carina leads the way through Poseidon's Tomb, Jack following her. They stop, panting, looking at the sight before them: The Trident of Poseidon]
CARINA: Look, Jack. There it is.
JACK: The Trident.
HENRY: Jack!
JACK: Huh? [he and Carina turn to see Henry running at them, blade in hand. Henry jumps the coral, and Jack shoves her out of the way as Henry stabs forward, and the two begin to fight.
Carina looks at the Trident and runs for it, trying to pull it free. Salazar's crew sink to the bottom of the ocean on either side of the open corridor. Jack is backed against the wall of the water, and looks back, where Lesaro sneers at him. Jack screams, turning to face the possessed Henry, who swings. Jack dodges, then swings and hits him]
JACK: [chuckling, then looks confused as Henry puts a hand to his face, marveling at the blood] Huh?
HENRY: You cut me. You cut the boy, Jack.
[Jack looks horrified for a moment before the fight continues, realizing what happened. Jack is soon disarmed and flees over a mound of rock and coral. Carina yells and soon forces the Trident free. It's blasted by water, hitting the ground. The blast hits "Henry" and sweeps him away. Carina looks over at the Trident, then runs to it. Another set of hands grabs it at the same time, and she looks up to see Henry, a malevolent smile on his face]
CARINA: Henry!
[The two struggle with it, trying to keep it from the other. "Henry" uses the force of the Trident to blast Carina away, and she hits the dirt, stunned. Henry's face begins to crack, as Salazar's ghost form does, and the body of Henry Turner topples away, leaving Salazar himself to hold it. Jack pulls himself up to see Armando Salazar with the Trident]
SALAZAR: Hola, Sparrow.
JACK: Oh no.
SALAZAR: [points the Trident at one of the water walls, seeing he can control it. He smiles] I hate the Sparrow. Die, Sparrow. [Salazar swings, and a stream of water rushes for Jack, carrying him along and slamming him into a rock. He slides down, stunned and groaning]
CARINA: [runs to Henry's prone form] Henry! He's walking on land. Please! Henry, wake up! [she turns to see Lesaro and the other crew approaching from the water and glares at them] Oh, piss off!
[Salazar uses another flurry of water to carry Jack around, half drowning the pirate as he helps]
CARINA: [smacking Henry's face repeatedly] Henry, wake up! He's killing Jack. [she looks up, horrified.
Jack is carried into the ocean, where Salazar's crew grabs at him. His screams are muffled until he breaks into the corridor again, and the crewmembers vanish into smoke]
CARINA: Henry! [she shakes him]
HENRY: [awakens abruptly] Power of the sea.
CARINA: What?
HENRY: The power of the sea.
CARINA: "To release the power of the sea...all must divide."
[Salazar keeps swinging Jack around in the waterspout, creating a whirlpool around him. Jack screams as he's tossed about]
CARINA: If the Trident holds all the power, then...
HENRY: Then every curse is held inside.
JACK: [slowly gets to his feet as Salazar advances on him. Jack can barely muster the strength to get onto his hands and knees, spitting water. He coughs] As I told you before, surrender to me now and I'll let you... [he looks up, seeing how bad his predicament is] ...live.
SALAZAR: You want me to surrender?
JACK: [stands and jams his hat back onto his head] Maybe.
SALAZAR: This is where the tale ends! [he hefts the Trident and stabs it into Jack's chest. Jack groans as Salazar drives him back]
CARINA: No! [Henry turns, and they both watch in horror as Jack is pinned to a rock. Jack looks at the Trident, mouth open, shaking, then up at Salazar]
SALAZAR: Shh. [Jack looks down at the Trident, then smirks up at Salazar. Salazar looks, seeing Galileo's Diary hidden beneath Jack's waistcoat, which had taken the impact]
HENRY: ...divide.
JACK: Henry! [he grabs the Trident, fighting with Salazar so the Spaniard doesn't pull it free and actually kill him]
HENRY: [dazed] Divide. Break.
CARINA: Break the Trident and you'll...
BOTH: [Henry gets up and starts running] ...break every curse at sea!
[Henry pulls his sword free, running to where Jack and Salazar are struggling with the Trident. He swings down, hard, breaking the glowing gem in the Trident's head and shattering the artifact. The power ripples through the ocean as Salazar stumbles forward, wheezing. His men underwater start choking as their curse reverses. Henry steps back with Carina and Jack, sheathing his sword. Lesaro breaks free from the water, and the rest of his men follow suit. Salazar's face begins to return to normal, and he slowly feels his skin]
HENRY: All curses are broken.
[Salazar slowly laughs as he straightens, and his crew follows suit. Carina looks up, seeing water start to leak, the walls closing in as the ocean returns to what it was]
SALAZAR: We are flesh and blood! [he looks up]
[Meanwhile, the BLACK PEARL sails just along the side of the closing gap, looking for the three members of their crew down below. The anchor lowers, and Hector Barbossa stands on it. His hat, wig, and coat are gone as he grips one of the chains]
JACK: The Pearl! My Pearl!
CARINA: Climb!
BARBOSSA: Move! Fast!
GIBBS: [up top, at the helm] Hold it steady, boys! Don't let her slip!
[Salazar looks, seeing the trio running for the anchor, then breaks into a sprint]
SALAZAR: Jack!
[His crew clamors behind him, not wanting to drown after being given life again. Barbossa looks up, then at the approaching trio]
BARBOSSA: Jump! Faster!
[Henry and Carina climb on, Jack behind them. Carina is the first to start to climb up the anchor. The quartet make their way up the chain as Salazar gains on them. The anchor slowly submerges]
BARBOSSA: Up! Anchor!
GIBBS: Get the anchor up, quick!
SCRUM: [to the others] Stop! Stop! Bring it up! Bring it up! Bring it up! Come on!
[Salazar reaches the anchor and starts climbing, his crew after him]
SCRUM: Bring it up!
LESARO: Capitán! [he was unable to get to the anchor, while Salazar is climbing the chain] Capitán!
[Salazar barely looks down before continuing his ascent. The others are over halfway up at this point, but Salazar is gaining fast. The chain hits a rock and the ship jolts]
SCRUM: Oh, crumbs! [He topples forward as the wooden lever on the capstan breaks. The men grunt as the anchor stops, then starts lowering until they can get it under control again. The chain stops, goes taut, then starts pulling back into the ship. The jolt sends Carina flying off, screaming, until Barbossa catches her]
JACK: [horrified] Oooh!
BARBOSSA: [holding on to Carina's hand as she struggles to find the anchor chain] I've got you! [She looks down, then grabs the chain and back up, fear ebbing away]
SCRUM: Stronger!
[Carina looks up at Barbossa, then notices something. A tattoo of a familiar five star constellation on the inside of his forearm. Barbossa sees her looking and gives a small, genuine smile]
CARINA: Who am I to you?
BARBOSSA: [reverently] Treasure.
[As Carina realizes the implications of this, Barbossa looks past her, seeing Salazar close to his daughter. He raises his sword, ready to strike]
BARBOSSA: Hold on!
[Carina carefully twists her hand to grab the chain]
JACK: [looking down, seeing all that's happened] Hector!
[Barbossa looks up as Jack reaches down with his boot and takes Henry's sword, letting it drop straight down. Barbossa lets go of the chain to grab the sword, locking eyes with Carina as he falls past her. He looks peaceful. He falls and falls, stabbing Salazar on the way down, both men falling.
Salazar screams, his head hitting the anchor, then his body limply hitting the water. Jack, Henry, and Carina all watch, all with different emotions on their faces. Hector Barbossa looks back up at them, face still peaceful; he's dying on his own terms, protecting his most valuable treasure. He closes his eyes before his body hits the waves and is lost forever.
The waters close in and Jack screams as they're overtaken. The BLACK PEARL is on the open sea again as the waves close. The anchor chain continues to move up]
PIRATE: Hold her starboard!
[As the chain rises, Jack, Carina, and Henry are all together, coughing and holding on to the chain. Jack's hat has been lost in the waves. The crew rushes over and starts cheering, seeing the successful venture. The trio is helped aboard. Jack stands, looking at the ocean]
JACK: Pirate's life, Hector.
[Jack the Monkey looks sad from his position on the rigging. Carina looks up from the waves, staring off into the distance, trying to process everything. Murtogg and Mullroy look at each other, realizing what Barbossa's absence means. Both remove their hats and place them over their hearts. Gibbs gasps, and puts his hand over his own heart. The crew follows suit, paying tribute to one of the Pearl's two captains.
Henry looks over at Carina, not sure what to do. Jack nudges Henry's hand with Galileo's diary. Henry looks over and takes it, then walks over to her]
HENRY: You all right?
CARINA: I don't know. For a moment, I had everything, Henry. Now, it's all gone again.
HENRY: It's not all gone, Ms. Smyth. [he offers the diary out to her. Carina's lips move soundlessly as she takes it. There's a hole where the Trident stabbed it. Carina runs her thumb over it, looking up at him]
CARINA: Barbossa. My name is Barbossa.
[The ship sails off into the morning sunlight, which blinds all...turning into a flame reflecting off of the lighthouse where Henry grew up. He walks through the grass with Carina some undetermined time later. Both look out at the horizon, but Carina soon turns to watching Henry, who shifts nervously]
HENRY: Maybe Jack was right.
CARINA: About what?
HENRY: The unscratchable itch. [after a moment, he turns, leaning in to kiss her, but she slaps him. He blinks, then turns to her, frustrated again] What did you do that for?
CARINA: Just checking it's truly you. That you're not still a ghost. [she caresses his cheek briefly]
HENRY: [smiles] It's me.
CARINA: Then I was...
HENRY: Wrong.
CARINA: Slightly in error. Although...
[Henry leans in and kisses her. The two share it for a moment before gently pulling away]
HENRY: Apology accepted. [He leans in to kiss her again when there's the sound of shouting, a ship making anchor. He takes out his spyglass and looks, seeing the Flying Dutchman. He looks at Carina, smiling a little] The Dutchman. [He looks back up, hopeful, then puts the spyglass to his eye again. He looks at the ship, and a familiar figure soon moves in front of it as he walks up the hill. William Turner, curse broken, strides up the hill, and into sight.
Henry puts the spyglass down and goes to meet his father. Carina stays where she is, giving a respectable distance. Will looks at the young man approaching him, not seeming to recognize him. The two stop as they meet. Henry pulls off his necklace swiftly, holding it out. Will carefully takes it]
WILL: Henry. [he looks over his grown son]
HENRY: Yes, Father.
[Will pulls him into a tight hug as Henry smiles. Will steps back, patting his shoulders, looking over his arms, his hands, amazed at the young man in front of him]
WILL: Let me look at you, son. [both of them chuckle] How did you do it? [he puts an arm around Henry's shoulders, and they both start walking up the hill] How did you break the curse?
HENRY: Let me tell you a tale. A tale of the greatest treasure known to man. [he shares his father's grin]
WILL: [patting his shoulder, both arms slipping away from them] That's a tale I wanna hear.
[Both chuckle, then stop short as at the top of the hill, a figure crests it, holding her skirts.
ELIZABETH TURNER looks like she can't believe the sight in front of her. Will looks the same as they lock eyes. Will looks at Henry briefly, smiling, before walking quickly, then breaking into a sprint. Elizabeth smiles and takes off towards the love of her life.
Both slow as they near each other, but don't stop. Not hesitating, they throw their arms around each other, Will wrapping her up tightly. They bury their faces in each other's shoulders, just holding each other.
Henry approaches a smiling Carina, relieved to see his parents happy and together again. He takes her hand.
Will and Elizabeth slowly pull away from each other, only to kiss.
In the distance, the BLACK PEARL is barely visible. Jack watches the two couples, then puts his spyglass down]
JACK: What a truly revolting sight.
GIBBS: Make way! Captain Jack Sparrow on deck!
JACK: [points at him] Indeed! [he bows with a flourish, then makes his way to the quarterdeck as the crew pays their respects, Murtogg and Mullroy among them]
PIRATE: Welcome back, Captain.
JACK: Oh, thank you very much. Coming through.
SCRUM: Captain!
JACK: Thank you. I remember you. Sirs. Thank you. Oh, good. Master Gibbs.
GIBBS: The ship is yours, Captain.
JACK: Ah, thank you. [Jack walks up to the helm, sliding his fingers over the wood and taking his place, happy to be back on his beloved PEARL. A faint smile pulls at his lips.
Jack the Monkey climbs up, something in his mouth]
JACK: [gasps] Monkey.
[Jack the Monkey releases the cord between his teeth and holds out Jack's compass as an offering, slowly. Just as slowly, Jack takes it, smiling uneasily and eyeing the creature]
JACK: Thank you.
GIBBS: [looking at a set of charts] What be our heading, Captain?
JACK: We shall follow the stars, Master Gibbs.
GIBBS: Aye aye, Captain! [he tosses the charts with a smile]
[Jack opens the compass, watching the needlepoint sway]
JACK: I have a rendezvous beyond my beloved horizon.
[Jack puts a hand back on the helm as the ship busies itself. Jack the Monkey hops onto his shoulder and Jack looks at him nervously, then settles as both Jacks realize this is how it will be now. The BLACK PEARL sails the seas into the horizon...forever.]
