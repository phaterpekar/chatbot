[Lots of dark waters. A fishing boat sits on the water. Two fishermen pull up a net, something lumpy in it.]
Fisherman: Capitán! Capitán!
[The net drops to the deck, revealing a scraggly castaway. The Captain and Fisherman make the sign of the cross. The Captain pushes the body over, revealing a Logbook.]
Captain: Who are you?
[The Fisherman and Captain pull away bits and pieces of things, As the Captain reaches for the book, the castaway suddenly sits up with a blank stare. The scene cuts to a carriage being carried by two horses through a forest. It arrives at a castle (Cadiz, Spain shown in the corner). The gate opens as it passes on through. Another set of doors open, this time indoors. The Captain and Fisherman enter the room holding the Castaway between them. Yet more doors open, this time it's King Ferdinand and his officials. The Captain and Fisherman set the Castaway on the ground and open the sheet hiding him. The two kneel down.]
Ferdinand: What is this?
Captain: Your Majesty. Caught him out in a fishing net. A fishing net!
Fisherman: He's been telling stories. Stories that --
Captain: We believe he's found the --
[The castaway's head moves slightly, and Ferdinand holds up his hand. Silence falls. He bends down and takes the logbook as the Spaniard comes up behind him. Folds his hands together.]
Castaway: ...Ponce de Leon.
[Ferdinand glances up sharply]
Captain: Says he found Ponce de Leon's ship.
Fisherman: Or sailed on it.
[Ferdinand looks over at the Spaniard as the Captain and Fisherman argue]
Captain: No, I told you! Ponce de Leon died 200 years ago!
Fisherman: Aye, but he died searching for something, didn't he?
[Ferdinand flips through the book. Lots of notes and there's an awkward symbol.]
Ferdinand: The Fountain of Youth. [they all glance upwards slowly. The King looks to the Spaniard.] How soon can you sail?
Spaniard: ...With the tide.
[TITLE: A water droplet falls, creating ripples.In the background, notes from the logbook is shown, and a mermaid drifts past under moonlight. First "ON STRANGER TIDES" appears, then right after that "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN".]
Picture
[A carriage passes under an archway (London, England appears in the center). A ton of people all over the street. A man holds up a sign advertising a pirate execution at the Old Bailey.]
Someone off-screen: PIRATE SWORDS! PIRATE SWORDS!
Man: PIRATE EXECUTION TODAY! WATCH HIM SWING! [points backwards]
[Some boys jump and try to reach for toys of hanging pirates on a stick from a guy that looks like Ragetti. Two more play with wooden swords.]
Another person: Pirate puppets!
Boy: Take that, you! (Strangely, you can't really hear this quote)
[A girl and her father make their way through the crowds]
Girl: Hurry, Papa! Or we'll miss the hanging!
Father: It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial. The hanging comes this afternoon.
Same guy from earlier: PIRATE HANGING TODAY!
[Bars open, a Jailor grabs a hooded prisoner from his cell.]
Jailor: Come on! Up you get! Move along, pirate! [shoves him against a wall] Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"? [laughs] Come on! Up you go! [they go up stairs]
[Shot of crowds going wild, some kids hang from balconies holding their toy hanged-pirates-on-a-stick. Banging sound in the background.]
Someone: Order! Order!
Bailiff: Now appearing before the court, the notorious and infamous pirate, pillager, and highwayman - Captain Jack Sparrow!
[The same Jailor brings the prisoner towards a pedestal. As soon as the Bailiff mentions Jack the hood is yanked off.]
Gibbs: [squints around at the sudden bright light] I told ya! The name's Gibbs! Joshamee Gibbs! How many times do I --
Bailiff: Hear ye, hear ye! Presiding over these trials, all rise and attend to the right honorable Justice Smith!
[Everyone gets up, doors open revealing someone in a big wig. Several people bow. Someone mutters to the Bailiff, handing him a stack of bills. The crowd sits back down, gets quiet as the guy in the wig pulls down his glasses - but a familiar voice!]
Jack: Now. What do we have here? [he smiles, and we can see his powdered mustache and beard...and gold teeth.]
Gibbs: [incredulous] Jack?
[The Jailor clubs him on the back of the head, the crowd roars]
One of the wigged guys: I don't recognize him. (This quote is also hard to hear)
Jack: Not necessary! You were saying?
Gibbs: Jack Sparrow is not my name. My name is Joshamee Gibbs!
Jack: [thoughtful] Is that so? It says "Jack Sparrow" here.
Gibbs: I told 'em! I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would be happy to identify to the court, if it would help my case.
Jack: I think that would be a poor defense unless you want to be bludgeoned again like a harp seal. [crowd roars somewhat] The prisoner claims to be innocent of being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?
[The Foreman stands up]
Foreman: No trial? But aren't we here to examine the evidence?
Jack: Foreman. Your finding. Guilty?
Foreman: Guilty verdict means he'll hang.
[Very loud roaring and hand-drumming]
Woman: HANG HIM! STRING HIM UP!
[Jack glances around. It gets quiet.]
Foreman: ...Guilty?
Gibbs: [at the same time as the crowd roars loudly] THAT'S NOT FAIR!
Jack: Shut it! [bangs gavel] Joshamee Gibbs! The crime which you've been found guilty of is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow. [Gibbs looks bewildered] I hereby commute your sentence and order that you be imprisoned for the remainder of your miserable, moribund, mutton-chopped life.
Several people: Hang him!
Jack: There. [bangs gavel once]
[People stand up and roar louder than ever]
Same woman: STRING HIM UP, HANG HIM HIGH!
Bailiff: [as Gibbs is dragged back out] Means shall be arranged to transport this prisoner to the Tower of London!
[But he and the others look around as fruit pelts to the ground - Jack's gone. He goes down a hallway, removes the wig, glasses, and the robes. Opens a door, revealing the real judge, who makes muffling sounds. Jack puts the robe on him like a blanket.]
Jack: Thanks very much. [takes off the scarf]
[Jack takes his hat from a horse]
Jack: Ta. [pops it on, glances towards the driver.]
[The driver nods, and there's a skull-and-crossbones tattoo on his arm. Meanwhile another jailor is shoving Gibbs into the wagon. Jack appears and he gets shoved in too. As soon as the doors close, the wagon moves forward.]
Gibbs: Hell's teeth! Now we're both headed for prison. Jack: Not to worry. I've paid off the driver. Ten minutes, we'll be outside Londontown, horses waiting. Tonight we'll make the coast. Then it's just a matter of finding a ship. [drinks from a flask] [Wide view of the wagon going across a bridge] Gibbs: All part of the plan, yes? Jack: Exactly. I arrived in Londontown just this morning to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs from one appointment with the gallows. Seeing as how you're still alive, I'd say it's all been very successful thus far. [Gibbs drinks from the flask] What happened to you, Gibbs? I thought you were employed elsewhere or otherwise engaged. Gibbs: Aye. But I always listened like a thief for news of the Black Pearl. Nobody's seen where she might next make port - then, I hear a rumor. Jack Sparrow was in London, with a ship, and looking for a crew. Jack: Am not. Gibbs: But that's what I heard. Fact is, you're signing up men tonight, pub called Captain's Daughter. [takes a drink] Jack: Am. Not! [grabs flask and drinks] Gibbs: Well, I thought it a bit odd. Then, you've never been the most predictable of sorts. [drinks] Jack: Tell me something. There is another Jack Sparrow out there sullying my good name? Gibbs: An imposter. Jack: Indeed. But...an imposter with a ship. Gibbs: [off-screen, hands flask over] And in need of a crew. Jack: Which, as fate would have it, so am I. Gibbs: What about you, Jack? Last I heard, you were hell-bent to find the Fountain of Youth. [grabs map and unrolls it] Any luck? Jack: [takes it back] Circumstances arose, and forced to compelling insight regarding discretion and the valor. Gibbs: Meaning, you gave up. Jack: I did not! I am just as bent as ever! Hellishly so! I shall taste those waters, Master Gibbs...mark my words. Gibbs: There's the Jack I know! Jack: And I'll not have it said, there's a point on the map Captain Sparrow never found - [Sudden lurch] Oh. Short trip.
Picture
[They exit the wagon, but see MANY guards.] Gibbs: All part of the plan, yes? [Jack turns around to go back inside, but gets whacked on the back of the head by a guard's rifle.] Jack: ...No. [Two guards grab him and march away. One throws a sack of coins at the driver, while another two close the wagon.] [Two guards march Jack down a hallway, their footsteps in time with the background drums. They later manacle him to a chair and leave as Jack frantically jerks at the chains. The door finally closes and it's absolutely silent. Jack looks up at the balcony, the window. Sees a plate full of creme puffs on the table. Glances to the side, then the table again. He scoots the chair forward. Scoots again, glances. Scoots forward twice. Then he pulls his arm forward, ready to grab the creme puff, but a hidden door suddenly opens. He gets scared and kicks the table from under, the creme puff rolls out of its plate and he kicks it with the toe of his boot and it flies upwards. He crosses his legs together as if nothing happened. A bunch of the guards file into the room. Jack looks up; the creme puff has stuck to the chandelier. Jack stares as King George enters, sits down.] Carteret: You ARE Jack Sparrow. Jack: ...There should be a "Captain" in there somewhere. George: I have heard of you. And you know who I am. Jack: Face is familiar; have I threatened you before? Pelham: You are in the presence of George Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg, Archtreasurer and Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire, King of Great Britian and Ireland ...and of you. Jack: [stares] Doesn't ring a bell. George: I am informed that you have come to London to procure a crew for your ship. Jack: [waves hand to the side] Vicious rumor. Not true. George: Then you lied to me when you told me you were Jack Sparrow. Jack: I am Jack Sparrow. But I am not here to procure a crew. [jiggles chains slightly] That is...someone else. George: Ah. Someone ELSE named Jack Sparrow. [to Carteret and Pelham] You brought me the wrong wastrel. Find the proper one, and dispose of this imposter! Jack: Oh, wait, wait, wait, hang on, wait a minute. I am Jack Sparrow, the one and only. And I am in London. [tries to jerk his hand free from the chains, rattling them] George: To procure a crew? Jack: What? [rattling gets nastier] George: To undertake a voyage to the Fountain - can someone please remove these infernal chains?!? [Two guards behind Jack come up to him.] Jack: [sighs in relief] Come, come. [George puts his fingers to his head as if he's stressed out. The Guards unlock the chains and walk off.] Pelham: We know you're in possession of a map. Carteret: So confiscate the map, and to the gallows with him! George: Have you a map? Jack: [pauses, glances around.] ...No. Pelham: Where is it? Jack: The truth? [stands up] I lost it. Quite recently, in fact. George: [as Jack admires the food] I have a report. The Spanish have located the Fountain of Youth. [just as Jack pokes some whipped cream, but flinches away every time George slams the table] I WILL NOT - HAVE SOME MELANCHOLY - SPANISH MONARCH - A CATHOLIC! - GAIN - ETERNAL - LIFE! [Finally, Jack dips a finger into the cream (stealing the cherry) and eats it] Pelham: You do know the way to the Fountain? Jack: 'Course I do. [flips away a handkerchief] Look at me! Carteret: You could guide an expedition? Jack: [positions a chair] With your permission, your heinie, you will be providing, then, a ship? [throws the handkerchief backwards behind him] And a crew? George: [leans back in his chair, gestures to Pelham, who gestures to the servants at the door] And...a captain. [Jack hides behind the chair as a man with a peg leg enters the room. He bows, and lo and behold, it's Barbossa.] Barbossa: Afternoon, sire. [Jack gives him a stern look as he limps over] If I may be so bold, why is that man not in chains? He must be manacled at once. George: [slight whiny, scornful voice] At the center of my palace? Hardly. Jack: Hector. How nice to see a fellow pirate make good of himself. Barbossa: Pirate? Nay. Privateer, on a sanctioned mission, under the authority and protection of the Crown. [fingers wig] Jack: As may be. First. What has become of my beloved Pearl? Barbossa: I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg! [slams peg leg on table, George moves his arms slightly] Jack: [disbelief] LOST THE PEARL? Barbossa: [lifts peg leg off table] I defended her mightily enough, but she be sunk, nonetheless. [Jack is so angry that he crawls over the table to get at him, but is held back by two guards.] Jack: If that ship be sunk, properly, you should be sunk with it. George: Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry, the Spanish outdistance us. I have every confidence you will prevail and be rewarded with the high station you so desire. Barbossa: [as he bows] To serve doth suffice, sire. Jack: You sir, have stooped. Barbossa: Jack, our sands be all but run. Where's the harm in joining the winning side? And you do meet a nicer class of person. Jack: I understand everything. Except that wig. [Jack breaks free of the guards, glances up at the creme puff. Kicks both guards' rifles upwards, grabs them, causing them to fire. One of the chains on the chandelier snaps, sending it swinging. Jack knocks the guards out with the butts of the rifles, then leaps on the table. He kicks a plate of food at another guard, then runs along the table, food flying everywhere. Knocks over a candle and backflips over to a chair and tosses it out the window. A guard takes out his sword and runs towards him. But he slips on the handkerchief and pummels out the window as Jack grabs a curtain tassel. A guard misses as he flies upwards to the windowledge. Just as the chandelier swings towards him he grabs hold of it. Barbossa and the others watch him. Jack gets to the balcony, snatches the creme puff. He bites into it and disappears. The rest of the guards file out of the main entrance.] George: ...He escaped? Barbossa: Leave it to me, sire. [George's expression freezes temporarily, then he does a dorky thumbs-up and smile face. Meanwhile Jack runs down some stairs, knocks away a guard's hat then speeds up again.] Guard: Guards! Guards! [The guard sets Jack's effects down on a table as he runs past in search of Jack along with some other guards. Jack peeks out from behind the table as soon as the coast is clear, then grabs the weapons. Scurries up even more stairs, runs through a hallway, pulls open a window and stops. Below is a busy street. Jack looks left and sees several banners. Looks back. Shot of the guards running up the same stairs, same hallway, same window - Jack isn't there.]
Picture
Guard: Find him! [The camera pans down to find Jack hiding behind one of the banners in a squatting position. The guard finally slowly backs out the window; just then Jack slips, his feet dangling. The guard sees his fingers appearing on top of the banner. He blows his whistle as Jack edges along it. Everyone below now see what's going on. Jack peeks out through a gap and notices that one of the tassels has fallen onto the ground. A boy runs over and picks it up, curiously looks up. His parents run over.] Guard: [as another guard opens a nearby window] There! [The other guard hacks away at the rope holding the banner with his sword. Jack shakes his head - he doesn't want to fall on the kid. The parents finally lead him away as the guard does a final slash. Jack plummets down into a passing carriage, landing face-first in a Society Lady's lap. She shrieks in horror. Jack sits up, stares at her rather seriously for a moment. Leans forward, bites off her earring as she sounds like she's about to faint. Jack climbs back out.] Society Lady: [peers out at him] Is that it? [Outside, Jack climbs onto the roof. The Society Lady smiles as if overcome by love, but then gasps out loud when she realizes her earring has gone. Jack has it in his mouth, hears guards coming. He eats it (I think, lol!) , turns around, then manages to stand up on his feet as the carriage is still moving. Everyone stares. Guards run madly, pushing through the crowd. Jack bends down as the carriage rounds a curve. Stands up again and now there's another carriage next to this one. The guards start to gain on him. Jack glances up and around a few times, then leaps onto the second carriage. Loses his balance slightly and puts one foot on each roof. The gap between them seems to be widening. He jumps back to the original carriage and it turns left. Jack jumps again, faceplanting onto a coffin. Looks back and sees the guards taking a shortcut through several columns. Jack steps onto a wooden plank carried by two men, squishes a man's top hat, then ends up on a cart full of coal. The guards run into nasty traffic and end up running into each other. Jack pushes aside the cart driver, they fight over the reins. Jack looks back once more and now the guards are on horses.] Guard: [pistol aimed] Fire! [Multiple shots hit the coal. Jack and the driver duck. One shot hits one of the lanterns, igniting the coal. Jack snaps the reins and the driver falls out. The cart hits a bump in the road, dumping the coal. Then it runs into a bread stand. Jack looks around as the guards on horseback chase after him. The James Holt sign on the cart hits a low-hanging roof and Jack grins, the guards are trapped by the flames. They go the opposite direction, following the cart's path.]
Picture
[Camera pans to find Jack dangling on the Captain's Daughter sign. His face is in the woman carving's boobs, he waits until the guards are gone, then drops to the ground.] [Jack grins triumphantly, but his smile instantly fades.] Guard: Filthy pirate. [He cocks the rifle, but then a BANG is heard. The guard falls forward. Jack turns around...and sees Teague appearing out of the shadows.] Teague: Hello, Jackie. [salutes] Jack: [salutes back] Hello, Dad. [Inside the Captain's Daughter pub: a woman screams and laughs rather weirdly. Someone snores as his drink pours out of his tankard; a woman nearby shoves him slightly. The camera goes to a corner by a window.] Old Bill: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Have a little tot of rum with Old Bill, here. Come on, be a good little pussycat. [One of the cats meow] Teague: I heard you were putting together a crew. Jack: If enough people keep saying it, then it must be true. Teague: ...Is that your tooth? Jack: Aye. I broke it, swallowed it, passed it, sifted it, retrieved it, polished it...fashion. Teague: I heard where you're headed. The Fountain. Jack: Have you been there? Teague: Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth? Jack: Depends on the light. Teague: Son, the Fountain. There be items required, for the Profane Ritual. Two Chalices. Jack: On the map, there was a Chalice -- Teague: Two. Silver. From Ponce de Leon's ship. You'll need both. Jack: For? Teague: The Ritual! Don't be a fool, Jackie! Find out every detail before you set sail. Jack: Set sail? I'd love to. But for that, I may need a ship. Teague: [singing is now heard prominently] Those folk, over there. They have a ship. They're signing up sailors right now. [Jack looks over, and sees Scrum with some ladies. They are singing.] Scrum and the women: My heart is pierced by Cupid, I disdain all glittering gold... [Jack turns back to Teague] Teague: And one last thing, Jackie. The Fountain tests you. [mysteriously] Mark my words. [The two toast each other, and drink. Jack glances back over at Scrum.] Scrum and the women: ...there is nothing can console me but my jolly sailor bold! Woman: Ha ha haaaa! [Jack glances back - but Teague is gone. Scrum continues playing his mandola as the ladies leave. But stops instantly as Jack holds a small knife to his throat.] Jack: I hear you be recruiting a crew. Scrum: Aye. That is, Jack Sparrow be puttin' together a modest venture. [Jack steps out of the shadows] You've got some nerve, ain't ya? Turnin' up here, dressed like that?! What, are you some kind of imposter? Jack: Do you have any idea who I am, mate? Scrum: [laughs, then to everyone] Oi! Muckers! Some bloke here what forgot his own name! [Everyone laughs hysterically. A door bangs open.] Derrick: Lads, I'm sailin' with Sparrow! Who'll buy a sailor a drink? Several men: Aye! [cheers]
Picture
[Jack spots a shadow on the wall. He follows it into the Captain's Daughter storeroom and looks around. The imposter appears from behind a column. At the same time, the two brandish their swords. Jack: You've stolen me and I'm here to take meself back. [The other Jack races back behind the post, Jack does the same, but on the other side. They peek out from either side and back. They instantly face each other and clash swords. The two run over to the barbecue pit and circle each other. They have the exact same movements. Jack runs a hand down his beard while the other Jack does the same.] Jack: Stop doing that. [The two instantly begin to fight; other Jack dodges out of the way. Other Jack slashes for a moment then Jack misses, his sword stuck in the hunk of roasting meat. He yanks it out then he and the other Jack battle near a stack of barrels. They spin around, fight again, then other Jack kicks Jack in the stomach and races up a ramp. Jack gets up and chases after the other Jack just as a barrel comes rolling down. He leaps over one of them and trips. As the second barrel appears, Jack dodges it by jumping off the ramp. He watches other Jack run along the rafters. Pulls a lever and the elevator takes hims up there. Carefully balances on a narrow beam between two chandeliers. Again the two fight, jumping along the bars. Jack snaps loose a pulley and swings on it, kicks other Jack and he grabs the bar and swings, lands on the ground on top of stacked barrels. Jack appears near him and yet again resume fighting; the barrels collapse. Still more fights, other Jack stomps on Jack's foot. After a while other Jack does a slash-spin move, swordpoint straight at Jack.] Jack: Only one person alive knows that move. [A pause, slight clash of swords, but then OTHER JACK KISSES JACK! A long kiss, then other Jack lets go.] Jack: Always wanted to do that. Hello, Angelica. [he rips off her fake beard] Angelica: Hello, Jack. [as she removes the "soul patch"] Are you impressed? I think I almost killed you once or twice there. Jack: I am touched at this most sincerest form of flattery. [uses sword to flip away her hat] But why? Angelica: [removing bandanna and wig, ruffling out her hair] You were the only pirate I thought I would pass for. Jack: That is not a compliment. Angelica: [Jack rips open her coat slightly revealing her boobs] Don't worry, Jack. I forgave you a long time ago. [rips off Borat-ish mustache] Jack: For what? For leaving you? Angelica: Recall that I left YOU. [walks off, Jack follows] Jack: A gentleman allows a lady to maintain her fictions. Angelica: Look, Sparrow, as long as my sailors get their money, they are willing to put up with any number of peculiarities. [moves off and Jack follows once more] Jack: Ah. But there is one peculiarity which I would not put up with. I will be impersonated as "Captain", nothing less. Angelica: Well, for that you need a ship. And as it turns out, I have one. Jack: ...I could use a ship. Angelica: I hear-tell you've been to the Fountain. Jack: There be a lot of hear-telling going on these days. Angelica: The Fountain of Youth. Jack: Dearest Angelica, fret not, you still have a few usable years left. Angelica: Haha! Always so charming. You didn't answer me. Jack: Eh? Ah, regarding the Fountain. Waste of time. Scrum: [Jack and Angelica instantly turn around at the sound of his voice] Milady! I see unseamenlike fellows of officious-looking nature! [Jack and Angelica take out their swords. Scrum looks outside then locks the door.] Angelica: Friends of yours? Jack: I may have unintentionally slighted some King or another. [Scrum piles stuff at the door.] Angelica: You haven't changed. Jack: Implying the need? Angelica: [faces him] Yes. Someone behind door: Open the door in the name of His Majesty! Angelica: You betrayed me. You seduced me and you used me. I was innocent of the ways of men. Jack: You demonstrated a lot of technique for someone I supposedly corrupted. [Angelica gives him a horrified, shocked look] Scrum: Imminent danger! Imminent now, milady! Someone behind door: OPEN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! [Jack hides in a corner] Angelica: I was ready to take my vows! And you - WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN A SPANISH CONVENT, ANYWAY? Jack: Mistook it for a brothel. Honest mistake. [Scrum runs just as the door is broken through. Immediately Jack and Angelica start fighting the Royal Guards. Scrum disappears up the stairs. Even more guards enter.] Angelica: We are at a disadvantage. Jack: [as he fights] Speak for yourself! Unlike some who pretend to be, that cannot in fact hold a candle to, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow! [Slices open a barrel, ale sprays out. Angelica joins in the barrel-stabbing, spraying the liquid everywhere. The guards slip and fall here and there. Jack lobs a barrel right at some guards and they fall down. Jack pokes a hole in one barrel and this time it's wine. He gulps hungrily from it, then Angelica pushes him away. The guards have their rifles aimed at them. Jack and Angelica glance at each other; Angelica slashes at a lever and the two drop down through a trapdoor into the water below. The guards watch as they swim away. Later they surface in the River Thames. Jack: How can you say I used you? Angelica: [exhaustedly] You know - exactly - how! Jack: I know, but how can you say it? [Angelica just grumbles] Angelica: So what is it. Jack: [miserably] What is what? [They land on the shore] Angelica: About the Fountain. What do you know? Jack: [empties his boot of water] You don't happen to be in possession of two Silver Chalices, circa Ponce de Leon? Angelica: No. Jack: Ha, thought not. Angelica: Why? Jack: I hear stories, rumors...you are of course aware of the Ritual. Angelica: Yes I am. Jack: [does his signature whiny "ooh" noise] What is it? What is required? [Instantly, a dart is shot into his neck. He plucks it out and stares at it.] Angelica: A mermaid, Jack. [Jack faints as the Quartermaster appears in the shadows. Angelica just grins.]
[In the Tower of London courtyard] Gibbs: There's been a mistake! It's a life sentence, not death. Life! [Guards open a gate as Barbossa enters.] Barbossa. Barbossa: Thank you, gentlemen. [throws some rope at him] I trust you can tie a noose. Gibbs: It's a hard thing. Forcing a man to twist his own hanging rope. [throws it back] Barbossa: You must lie in your bed the way you made it. [throws rope to Groves] Gibbs: What's happened to you? Barbossa: Where be Jack Sparrow? Gibbs: He escaped? Barbossa: [as Groves ties the rope] I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs. The HMS Providence sets sail at first light, and if you do not care hanging here dead with a mouth full of flies [Groves tosses the rope over the wooden platform]...speak now. Gibbs: Take me with you. Any point of the compass -- Barbossa: Take you WHERE, Gibbs? The Fountain? Aye? Is that where Jack be headed? Have you anything you can offer me, Gibbs? [imploringly] Anything at all? [Gillette hoists the noose up the platform] Upon my naked word, you'll not see the dawn! [Gibbs rolls out the map] ...Hand it over. [But Gibbs tosses it to the ground, grabs a lantern, and throws it on the map.] Barbossa: YOU FOOL! Gibbs: [as a shot of the Aqua de Vida logo and a mermaid drawing appears in the flames] I've just enough time to study those infernal circles, every route, every destination - all safe. In here. [points to his head] Barbossa: Welcome back to His Majesty's Navy, Master Gibbs! [walks off] [Shot of a weird symbol on a drawing of Whitecap Bay as it burns up]

[Shot of Jack sleeping in a hammock, swaying side to side gently. Just then he tumbles out onto the ground.] Scrum: [off-screen] SHOW A LEG, SAILOR! Jack: Aye, sir! [suddenly glances upwards] What? [Later, he is seen holding a mop, walking with Scrum] Jack: There's been a horrible mistake. Scrum: Keep moving. Jack: [trips over something] I'm not supposed to be here. Scrum: Many a man's woken up at sea, no idea what, when, wherefore or why, no memory of the night afore whence he drank away all his bonus money. [laughs] Jack: [they stop] No, no, no, you don't understand, mate. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. The original. The only! Scrum: Scrum. And the pleasure's all mine. Now keep moving. [Shot of a mop as it squishes into the deck. Hammering is heard as Jack and Scrum swab below deck. Some pirates are working on a glass coffin.] Jack: Scrum. [he secretly scrubs over towards him] Why is there a glass coffin? Scrum: Do I look like the man in charge? Jack: Where am I? Scrum: 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir. I be right honored to welcome you aboard our world-renowned vessel of infamy - Queen Anne's Revenge. [Camera pans right up into Jack's face] Jack: ...Blackbeard. [The QAR is seen sailing on. Shot of Gunner whipping someone, and Scrum falls onto the deck. The Quartermaster dumps more water for the deckswabbers.] Jack: He's a curious one. Scrum: [as Gunner inspects] He's been zombiefied. Jack: Eh? Scrum: Zombiefied. Blackbeard's doing. All the officers are the same. Makes 'em more compliant. [Gunner growls as he whips again, making everyone jump.] Jack: And perpetually ill-tempered. Scrum: [as Gunner gives Jack a mean look] Come on. Scrub. Jack: Yeah... [Shot of the flag, then several pirates working] Jack: [as he, Scrum, and Salaman pull a rope] Five days underway, at least. Scrum: Aye! You can tell that by the smell of the sea? Jack: The smell of the crew. [he ties off the rope, and looks up, spotting Philip Swift tied to the mast] Oi. What did that poor sod do? How can I make sure to not? Scrum: [looks in his direction] Him? Churchly fellow. Always going on about the Lord Almighty. Jack: Bible-thumper on this ship? [Cook appears, lets him sip from his pan] Scrum: A missionary's the story. What I heard, was he got captured in a raid. Rest of the ship got killed - but not him. First Mate wouldn't let it happen, on account of his premier standing with the Lord. First Mate sticking her neck out for some prisoner? That you don't see. [crosses arms] Jack: Her? Our First Mate is a her? Gunner: [far behind them] BACK TO WORK! [They duck, but Scrum scurries off. Jack looks over towards the poop deck. A sail furls upwards, revealing Angelica. Jack stares.] Angelica: Steady as she goes.
[Angelica is walking down the stairs, but just then Jack springs out of nowhere with a hook. He holds it to her throat.] Jack: You...are a ruthless, soulless, crossgrained cur. Angelica: I told you I had a ship. Jack: No, Blackbeard has a ship. Upon which I am now imprisoned. Angelica: We can do this, Jack. The Fountain of Youth. Like you always wanted. Jack: [takes away the hook] Blackbeard. Edward Teach. The pirate all pirates fear. Resurrector of the dead in his spare time. Angelica: He will listen to me. Jack: He listens to no one. Angelica: Maybe to his own daughter? Jack: Daughter, as in beget by? Angelica: Long-lost. Recently found. Who loves her dear papá with all her soul. Jack: He bought that? Angelica: I sold that. [Jack suddenly shoves Angelica to a hiding place just as a zombie walks by.] Jack: Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him or him and you, not you and me. Angelica: No, Jack, that's the best part. He will be dead. Jack: Ah. You'll be handling that part yourself, then. Angelica: There is a prophecy. Maybe you don't believe in the supernatural. Jack: No, no, no, I've seen a thing or two. Angelica: The Quartermaster. The man with no eyes. He is known as eleri ipin, witness of fate. He sees things before they happen. He's never wrong. Jack: I can do that too, if you don't count women, weather, and other things that are hard to predict. Angelica: [takes the hook from above Jack's head and holds it to his head] The prophecy is this: Blackbeard will meet his death, within a fortnight, at the hands of a one-legged man. [drags hook down his face] That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack. [walks away, Jack stares after her.] Jack: ...Interesting.
[Barbossa approaches Gillette and Groves at the helm. Groves turns around.] Groves: Orders, sir! Barbossa: I require a heading. I'll have my navigator to the helm. Groves: [salutes] Aye, sir! Barbossa: [waves hand] Well, smart now! [He and Gillette exchange a slight look, then they face the bow of the ship.] [Overhead shot of the HMS Providence. Gibbs is shown stumbling towards Barbossa.] Barbossa: Ah, Master Gibbs, short we are a map, perhaps you be so kind as to provide us a heading. [Gibbs walks over to the map in front of them, but glances back at Barbossa] Gibbs: Be a gem, and pour me a gulper? Barbossa: Nay! We be privateers, not pirates, Master Gibbs, and in the King's name, will behave as such. Gibbs: Aye. Captain. [Looks at the charts again, but takes a little while] Barbossa: [sternly] Be we on the proper course, Gibbs? Gibbs: Aye, it be proper. [points at the horizon] There's your proof. [Barbossa, Groves, and Gillette look in that direction, and Barbossa goes ahead of them to investigate. Groves looks through his spyglass.] Barbossa: ...The Spaniard. [There are three galleons sailing at a distance. Barbossa goes over to alert his crew] All hands! Battle stations! [as they set to] Get to windward! Harden up two points! Gillette: Two points! Cast loose the cannons! [Several sailors push forward the cannons] Barbossa: Gunners, take posts! ...Await orders. [They all stare at the galleons again] Gillette: Steady! Groves: Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir. [Barbossa grabs the spyglass and peers through it. The Spaniard and two of his men don't turn around.] Groves: Sir. Orders...? Sir. [Barbossa watches as they drift by, nothing else. Closes the glass.] Gibbs: He never so much as turned his head. Barbossa: [hands glass back] The Fountain is the prize. It appears we be not even worth the time to sink us. Now, we've fallen behind! All hands! Make more sail! [turns wheel] Ride hard between wind and tide!

[The shot of the flag from earlier. Several pirates, including Jack and Salaman, work on the sails.] Jack: Tonight. [Cuts to Salaman climbing down the rigging towards Ezekiel] Salaman: Psst! Tonight. [Cuts to Ezekiel peering through the stairs below deck at Cook, who's peeling potatoes] Ezekiel: Psst. Tonight. [Cuts to Cook throwing some peelings overboard to meet Garheng] Cook: ...Tonight. [Garheng climbs up the rigging] Garheng: Tonight. [He's actually speaking to Jack. Jack simply stays silent.] [Shot of the QAR, late evening. A candle is shown lit, pan up to show Jack.] Jack: The topic, gentlemen...is mutiny. [blows out stick and sets it down] Mutiny most foul. Salaman: Aye. I signed up to sail under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender. Ezekiel: And a lady at that. Cook: And mention was failed to made of this uncanny crew. Purser: Make my toes curl, they do. [The Cabin Boy appears with an armful of swords] Cabin Boy: I got 'em! [dumps them on the table] All of 'em. Crew: Aye! Good lad. Jack: On to it, then. Blackbeard. What are his habits? Scrum: Stays mostly to his cabin. Few: Stays mostly to his cabin. Stays to his cabin. Jack: Yes, but when he comes out... Cabin Boy: He don't really come out. Jack: ...He must come out sometime. [everyone mutters] Any of you sailed with him before? [more mutters] Any of you SEEN him before? [mutters] Stays to his cabin. No one's sailed with him, seen him...good news, gentlemen. This is NOT Blackbeard's ship! This is NOT the Queen Anne's Revenge - Scrum: Oh, oh, now, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge, right enough. Jack: How do you know? Scrum: I've seen the name. On the back of the ship. [nods like he's saying "Hurrr durrrrr."] [Jack simply stares, then looks around.] Jack: Gentlemen...sirs...fellow conscriptees, [a coin is turned around in someone's hand] You have been monstrously deceived. Salaman: We are decepted, then? Jack: Yes. You've nay been informed of the destination. Death lies before us, as we sail...for the Fountain of Youth. [the coin stops turning, silence] It be a sorry plight, mate. Derrick: Death...for certain. Garheng: The garden of darkened souls. Ezekiel: Untimely our ends will be. Jack: Unless - we take the ship. [Jack and Scrum stand up, Scrum takes a sword and jabs it into the table] Scrum: We take the ship, then. NOW! [scurries upstairs] [Awkward silence.] Jack: [waves hands] ...Go on, then. [Instantly everyone roars, go up, wake some pirates up, hand over weapons, etc.] [Jack sneaks into Angelica's cabin, where she snoozes on her bed. Jack watches for a second, then settles next to her.] Angelica: Hm...Jack...if this is a dream, you can keep the sword and boots on. If it's not - Jack: It's a dream. [Lots of fighting on the upper deck.] Angelica: ...No, it's NOT! [dumps him out] Jack: [gets back up] I thought I should give you fair warning, we're taking the ship. [makes for the door] Angelica: Desgraciado! Jack: Nothing personal! Angelica: [grabs her sword and chases after him] Sparrow, ven aqui o te arranco la cabeza! (Sparrow, come here or I'll rip your head off!) Jack: [closes door on her] You might be better off if you'd just - [The sword juts right through next to his head] Jack: ...Stay out of it. [A lot of battles, Scrum dodges a slash towards his stomach by some zombie; the Quartermaster knocks away someone over a cannon. He turns around just as a pirate stabs him right through the chest. The sword goes straight out his back. The Quartermaster simply stares down at it, then slowly pulls it back out. Throws the sword to the ground and slashes at the pirate just as the scene cuts to another zombie knocking someone against a wall. Jack walks along it and is spotted by Gunner.] Jack: Boggit. [Gunner slashes at Jack, who dodges. He keeps swinging some heavy weapon (an axe?). Eventually Jack trips him and he runs up the stairs. Gunner chases after him. Jack narrowly dodges another slash, ducks as Gunner swings the axe. Jack uses his sword to fend him off, then socks him in the face. Angelica appears from below deck and starts to battle the pirates. Jack punches Gunner again and he is knocked against the mast. Gunner swings the axe again but it gets stuck. Salaman tosses a net down from above and Gunner is caught in it. He struggles against it for several moments. Jack glances up to see Philip staring back down, then nods to Salaman. The two make their way to the mast as Cook leaps on top of Gunner. A bird's-eye view of Angelica still fighting.] [Jack and Salaman have reached Philip.] Salaman: [knife at Philip's chin] You're either with us, or against us! Philip: I'm not with you neither am I against you! Salaman: [to Jack] ...Can he do that? Jack: He's religious, I believe it's required. [Slices away the ropes entwining around his waist, and Philip grabs the rigging so as not to fall. A Bible is seen in his arms. Later, Jack is now back on the deck] Jack: FIGHT TO THE BITTER END, YOU CACK-HANDED DECK APES! [The Quartermaster hears him as he flips away a pirate. Almost immediately he takes on Jack. A few seconds later Jack stomps on his sword, kicks him backwards.] Jack: Take him, men, tie him down tight! [He runs up the stairs as Salaman and Garheng use a mop to apprehend the Quartermaster. Jack watches the scene below from the Captain's Cabin balcony. Angelica is restrained by several pirates; Gunner as well, all the rest of the zombies. Angelica stares as Jack raises his arms in victory.]

Jack: THE SHIP IS OURS! [The doors behind Jack suddenly open. Jack lowers his sword. Smile fades as he hears footsteps. Everyone stares in horror. It's Blackbeard - he drinks from a bottle of whiskey. Wind blows, ruffling his big smoky beard. Jack smiles slightly, then moves off-screen. Angelica, all ruffled up, tosses something to the ground. Cook watches as Gunner removes the net.] Blackbeard: Gentlemen. [shakes his head, takes a swig, then smashes the bottle. Jack, who was walking slowly down the stairs, jumps. Continues.] I be placed in a bewilderment. There I were, resting. [Shot of Angelica moving into view] And upon a sudden, I hear an ungodly row on deck. [Reaches down and rubs the jewels on his sword. As he talks, the rigging moves] Sailors abandoned their posts, without orders, without leave. [shot of his eyes as they dart back and forth] Men, before the mast...taking the ship for themselves. [Jack curiously watches the ropes.] What be that, First Mate? Angelica: Mutiny, Captain. Blackbeard: [hand to his ear] Again? Angelica: Mutiny! Blackbeard: Aye...mutiny. [a rope slithers towards someone's feet; as he takes out the sword] And what fate befalls mutineers, now we know the answer to that...do we not? Mutineers... HAAAAAAAAAAAAANG! [juts sword into the air] [Jack and the others fall forward as the ship suddenly goes full speed. Blackbeard juts his sword forward and a pirate is caught by both feet by ropes. One gets strangled around the whole body and dragged up stairs. Scrum and another pirate get tied back-to-back. A lot more pirates get tangled up in the mess. Blackbeard now moves the sword towards the left. One pirate tries to jump ship but ropes still grab him anyway. The Cabin Boy, tied around the waist, waves his arms and legs like he's swimming through the air. Wide shot of the QAR filled with tangled pirates. Blackbeard watches with a satisfied smile on his face, setting the sword on his shoulder. Just then Jack appears from above.] Jack: Captain, I wish to report a mutiny. [Blackbeard just looks] I can name fingers and point names. Blackbeard: No need, Mr. Sparrow. They are sheep. [gestures to everyone with his sword, then pointing it at Jack] You, their shepherd. [sheathes sword and Jack falls down.]
[Blackbeard and Angelica go down the stairs to go over to Jack.] Jack: Have I mentioned, sir, what a lovely daughter you have? Blackbeard: [pulls his pistol on him and he holds up his hands] A fitting last sight for a doomed soul. Angelica: [a whisper] Remember, Father. We need him. Blackbeard: If I don't kill a man every now and then, they forget who I am. Philip: [off-screen] COWARD! Blackbeard: [looks up] Hmm? Philip: [advancing towards them] They do not forget! Your crew sees you for the miscreant you are! A COWARD! No matter how many you slay! [The Quartermaster holds a sword to make him stay back] Blackbeard: Twice in one day, I find myself in a bewilderment. Philip: You are not bewildered, you are afraid. You dare not walk the path of righteousness, the way of the light. Blackbeard: No, sir, the truth of it be much simpler than all that. I'm a bad man. Philip: That, too. Blackbeard: I might have to kill you too, catechist. [points pistol at him] Angelica: NO! [pushes his arm down] Blackbeard: Oh, Latin blood, like her mother! Angelica: Father, I beg you! Blackbeard: Ah, there I be again, forgetting why the missionary was here. My daughter fears for my soul, what's left of it. You truly wish to save me, my child. [strokes her cheek] Angelica: Every soul can be saved. Blackbeard: Be that true, young cleric? Philip: Yes. Though you I see as a bit of long shot. Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul on this hellbound vessel. Blackbeard: [takes his hand away] You disarm me with your faith. [to the hanging crew] Eight bells! Which of you unfortunate souls stood watch? Jack: [gets up] I did. I stood watch. Blackbeard: [chuckles and shakes his head] ...Gunner? [The Gunner glances at the Cook, entangled in the ropes. Blackbeard looks in the same direction] ...You? Cook: Aye. [Jack looks up and around nervously] Blackbeard: Aye, the Cook. Perfect. Lower the longboat! [View of the Cook rowing away from the QAR] Blackbeard: Bring her about! [The Quartermaster turns the wheel, and the bow faces the longboat] Angelica: Why do you do this?!? Blackbeard: Mutiny. Our laws be clear. Angelica: Our laws allow the captain to show leniency. Blackbeard: I have given this man a chance to determine his fate. A gift not afforded to all. [Everyone watches as the Cook tries to row away desperately] Blackbeard: [to Philip] So, you, now... A chance to show the worth of your prayers. Pray he be delivered from...evil? [the Cook still tries to row] COURSE MADE! Philip: STOP! GIVE THAT MAN A CHANCE! GIVE YOURSELF -- [Just then, Greek fire flares out, the Cook ducks but it's useless. Blackbeard smiles evilly, Angelica and Philip looking on in disbelief. Angelica walks away. View of the longboat burning in a blazing inferno.] Blackbeard: You know when I feel closest to our Maker? When I see suffering, pain, and anguish. That's when the true design of this world is revealed. Philip: And I see it revealed when in times of hardship and tragedy, kindness and compassion are shown to those in need. Blackbeard: Perhaps you should pray for him to be unharmed, yes? Philip: [slams his Bible down on the rail] Please, there's still hope -- Blackbeard: AGAIN! [Greek fire blazes out once again at the already-burning boat, the firelight reflected in Jack and the crew's faces.]

[The Quartermaster sticks a knife into Jack's shirt, pinning him to the wall] Jack: I actually have no interest in the Fountain whatsoever, so if your heart is set, you may drop me off anywhere you like. Blackbeard: [back turned] That'll be all, Quartermaster. [the Quartermaster leaves, then he faces Jack.] Your words surround you like fog, make you hard to see. Jack: And what of you? The mighty Blackbeard. Beheaded, they say. Still, your body swam three times around your ship then climbed back onboard. And here you are. Running scared. [Blackbeard is now very close to him, seemingly inspecting him] Blackbeard: Scared. [walks over to his desk] Jack: To the Fountain. Blackbeard: The Quartermaster sees things before they happen. [Jack glances at the knife] He has foreseen my death. And so the fates have spoken. The threads of destiny woven. [sits down] Jack: You have a ridiculously high regard for fate, mate. Blackbeard: And you? Jack: Me? I'm skeptical of predicting any future which includes me. [secretly reaches for the knife] Blackbeard: It be foolish to BATTLE fate, but I'd be tempted to cheat it. [meanwhile, Jack is tugging at the handle, pulls out the knife.] I will reach the Fountain. You will lead me. [Jack slowly approaches him, knife in hand as if ready to stab him. He doesn't look up.] That knife will serve you no better than the mutiny you devised. Jack: Mutiny served me well. It gained me an audience with you. Blackbeard: [glances up from something] Oh? Jack: Aye. To warn you. [slams the knife into the table] Regarding your First Mate. Who pretends to be persons she is not. Blackbeard: [mean look] Do tell. Jack: She is not your daughter. [Blackbeard stares at him, disbelieving.] [Outside, Angelica goes over to the Captain's Cabin door, listens in] Blackbeard: You dare to speak thusly of my flesh and blood? Jack: Sir. The woman is consummate in the art of deception. I know. As I mostly unwittingly set her on the wicked path. [Blackbeard has looked back down] Though I cannot claim credit for her existing abundance in natural talent. [At this, Blackbeard holds up the voodoo doll.] Blackbeard: Angelica. My beloved daughter, the one true good thing I have done in this life and you claim to be the one who corrupted her? Jack: Sir. What she is, is pure evil. More to be feared than a wild beast. HUNGRY wild beast, with gnashing teeth! Vengeful, hungry, from hell, beast -- Angelica: [bursts in] Father! Jack: [instantly turns around with a wide grin] Sweetness! [Blackbeard suddenly stabs the voodoo doll with the knife. Jack keels over in pain. He glances over.] Angelica: No need to hurt him, Father. He will help us. Won't you, Jack? [He's still in pain, doesn't say anything] Blackbeard: You see? Even now, she attends to your welfare. [he is carving something into the doll and jabbing it repeatedly] Giving lie to the claims you make of her. [makes a final slash, and Jack jerks backwards against a bulkhead. He pulls open his shirt, revealing a devil pitchfork scar.] Angelica: [to Jack] You WILL lead us to the Fountain. Yes? Blackbeard: Put another way. If I do not make it to the Fountain in time... [dangles the doll over the candle by its head] ...neither will you. [The Cook, zombiefied, appears with the Quartermaster in the doorway. He is led away after a few moments.] Jack: [clutches his head as if he has a headache] I will have a wee look-see at those charts straightaway then, shall I?
[Barbossa is seen pouring some sort of drink into a cup, then chews apple slices with a fork. Groves approaches him.] Groves: Sir. Barbossa: [sets down fork] ...Aye?
Groves: Captain. Sir. I am unhappy to report rumors, sir, among the crew as to our destination. Barbossa: [back turned] Shut your trap and make way.
[Groves doesn't move. Barbossa lugs his peg leg off something and gets up, grabs his crutch.] Barbossa: That's the way of it, then? Groves: No disrespect. Sir.
Barbossa: What do the men fear? Say it. Speak the words.
Groves: Whitecap Bay.
Barbossa: Aye, Whitecap Bay! [limps over to where the crew has assembled] Every worthless seaman fears the name, and rightly so, though few know why or dare to ask.
Gibbs: Be the stories true?
Barbossa: Listen that your voice should quiver like a fiddle string! Say what robs you of your staunch heart, Gibbs, or forever leave it to the whiter fields of fancy.
Gibbs: Mermaids, Captain?
Barbossa: Aye. Mermaids. Sea ghouls, devilfish...dreadful in hunger for flesh of man. Mermaid waters, that be our path. Cling to your soul, Gibbs, as mermaids be given to take the rest, to the bone.
[Everyone mutters in fear]
Groves: Steady! Steady, men! Find your courage! Or be ready to purpose your fear!
[A guy runs through the crowd, trying to escape]
Guy: SAVE YOURSELVES! [leaps overboard]
Someone: Man overboard!
Barbossa: Nay! A deserter!
Groves: Come about! Barbossa: Nay! Gentlemen. I should not ask any more of a man than what that man can deliver, but I do ask this: are we not King's men? Crew: ...Aye. Barbossa: On the King's mission? Crew: ...Aye. Barbossa: I did not note any fear in the eyes of the Spanish as they passed us by. ARE WE NOT KING'S MEN?
Crew: AYE!!!
Barbossa: Aye! Hands aloft, and bear away! Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

[Jack holds up the Ring of Thieves, turning it in his fingers, examining it. Grins slightly. Hears footsteps, then hides it in his dreadlocks behind his ear.] [Angelica appears on deck, Scrum plays his mandola.] Jack: Hola. [bends down and pulls a bottle out from the cannon he's sitting on] Come. Little drink? Angelica: Wine, music, candlelight...I think we've traveled down this road before, Jack. Jack: Yes, we have. [tosses her a goblet] I remember it well. [pops off the bottle's cork with his mouth and blows it away, then steps closer to her] Winding, twisting, and turning, gyrating, writhing...incessant writhing. [pours some wine into his goblet, shows her the lace on his wrist] Do you recall St. Dominique? Angelica: La Martinique. I tried to kill you in St. Dominique. Jack: Either or. [pours her glass] Angelica: Hardly appropriate for a First Mate. Jack: Was I the first? I've often wondered. Angelica: You can be so charming when you want something, Jack. The trick is finding out what. [Scrum plays more dramatically] Jack: The truth, then, is it? Blackbeard has served his purpose. You and I can go to the Fountain together, where we shall bathe one another in equal shares of fame. And other assorted debaucheries. Angelica: And I tell you the Ritual of the Fountain. Jack: Yes. The Profane Ritual. [He swings her around, he runs over to a line while she grabs another rope. Angelica looks like she's wondering where he went. Jack swings away off the rail, circles back, landing behind her. Pokes her on the shoulder and she turns around in surprise.]
Jack: May I cut in? I have something you might find an interest. [he slightly puts her arm around his neck; he pulls out the ring and shows it to her] First item I ever stole...for someone else. [He dangles it in the air, out of her reach] Angelica: [tries to grab it] I had to trade it to learn the rules of the Fountain. [Jack grabs her by the neck] Jack: [whispers] Tell me the rules. [He swings her to the ground.] Angelica: Can I trust you, Jack? [he comes towards her holding the Ring of Thieves] I need you on my side. Jack: [as he assumes a somewhat suggestive position] Oh, my dearest Angelica, [voice turns into a whisper; slips the ring onto her finger with slight difficulty] you and I are as thick as thieves, love. Tell me the rules. Angelica: [strokes his chin] Water...from the Fountain of Youth. [they flip over, now Angelica's on top] The shimmering tear of a mermaid. [strokes his cheek, he likes it] the Silver Chalices of Ponce de Leon... Jack: [faraway look] Huhuh...
Angelica: [runs her lips on his cheek] With these items...
Jack: [slightly comes out of the trance] Yes. Angelica: [as she stands up] With these items, you may take all of the years of life from another, Jack. Jack: [instantly gets up, surprised] Eh? Angelica: You know what that means. We cannot go alone, you and I. [touches his cheek] The Ritual requires a victim.
Jack: That is unfortunate. Angelica: [fingering his beard] Yes, it is. Jack: [as the two go back down] I find my desire for the Fountain greatly lessened. Angelica: But there is something on board you do want.

[In the Captain's Cabin, Angelica opens a lock to a huge cabinet.] Jack: What about Blackbeard? Angelica: He's in the chartroom. We'll have to be quick. [she opens the doors, revealing lots and lots of bottles. Together, they inspect each one - and there are ships in them.] He keeps each ship as a prize. You help me, and I promise you your pick. Though I think I know the one you will choose. [Shot of the Black Pearl sailing on captured stormy seas, along with thunder and lightning] Jack: The Black Pearl in a bottle? Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle? [Jack the Monkey crawls up the rigging, screeches] Ahh! He's even more annoying in miniature. Angelica: Do we have a deal, Jack? Jack: Angelica, I know you. You are not going to steal the life of some innocent man. Angelica: What about the one-legged man? [closes the cabinet] I need years, Jack. Not for me. For my father. I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard. Jack: You've fallen for your own con, love. Angelica: No. He IS my father. The lies I told you were not lies. Jack: You lied to me by telling the truth? Angelica: Yes. Jack: That's very good, may I use that? Angelica: I'm sure you will anyway. [turns to leave] Jack: I mean, of course I would. So you will not give up this quest, then. [On the table is the voodoo doll.] Angelica: I want a father, Jack. I haven't had one. Jack: Angelica. Your father, Blackbeard. He is evil, and he will kill you, given the chance. [Angelica picks up the doll] He cannot be saved. Angelica: And who are you to set the limits on redemption? You stole years of my life, Jack. You owe me. [Jack turns away. Angelica exhales her breath down the doll's neck. Jack stops in his tracks, looks a little queasy.] Angelica: [rather softly; stroking the doll's hair] I wonder...does it work because it works or because you believe that it works? Jack: [turns back around] Or because I...WANT you to believe that it works? Angelica: [nuzzling the doll against her face] Or because you want me to believe you are only pretending for it to work? When in fact it does. [the doll is now at her neck] Nothing is beyond you, Jack. [Jack shakes his head very quickly, causing his dangles to jingle and his cheeks to jiggle like flab. She now drags the doll against her boobs] You are unpredictable. [he nods this time] Untamable. [he makes his signature groaning sound when she presses it again] That's why I'm drawn to you. Jack: You smell lovely. [Angelica removes the doll from her boobs] But that's beside the point. Angelica: When are you going to admit, Jack Sparrow...that you want me...
Jack: [drags his hands down her arms] I want you. Next question? (Final cut: And you are en route to getting yourself killed, and I'm not inclined to stand by and watch.)
Quartermaster: [ringing the bells] WHITECAP BAY!
[Angelica jerks her hand away before Jack can grab the doll. She looks slightly sly.]

[A lighthouse in the far distance.] Blackbeard: All hands on deck! Set to the longboats! [Everyone gets onshore] Blackbeard: [as several pirates get out a huge net] Lay 'em out flat! No tangles! Make 'em look...pretty for our dainty guests. [to Angelica] We're going to need light. A lot of light. [to some others with him on the dock, including Jack] Come! [They all climb up wooden steps to the lighthouse.] Salaman: Smell that? Whale oil. Stuff burns like a miracle from God.
Blackbeard: Can you make it work?
Salaman: Made by the English! Let's not get our hopes up.
[Angelica goes over to Jack, who's at the window]
Angelica: The old moon in the arms of the new one. First of the summer. Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.
[The oil is lighted, and the beam moves around a bit, and lands on a longboat. The pirates squint at it.] Ezekiel: We're doomed. They be drawn to manmade light!
Cabin Boy: Sharks?
Ezekiel: Worse than sharks, boy. There'll be mermaids upon us within the hour, you mark my words! And we're the bait!
Derrick: I heard it said that a kiss from a mermaid protects a sailor from drowning.
Ezekiel: Don't be a fool. Mermaids are all female, son. And lovely as a dream of heaven. But when it comes to churn butter, so to speak, they snatch a sailor off a boat or the deck of a ship, have their way, then the sailors are pulled to bottom, and drowned...AND EATEN!
Scrum: [whisper] Sometimes...the other way around.
Gunner: [off-screen] Sing.
Scrum: What?
Gunner: They like to hear singing.
Scrum: ...My name it is Maria, a merchant's daughter fair...
Gunner: Louder.
Scrum: ...and I have left my parents and three thousand pounds a year...my heart is pierced by Cupid, [nods to the others] I disdain all glittering gold. All: There is nothing that can console me but my jolly sailor bold...
Picture
[Later] Scrum: [tiredly] My heart is pierced by Cupid...I disdain...all glittering gold...there is nothing that can console me...[Philip wakes up]...but my jolly sailor bold... [Philip sees something drifting by in the water. Scrum sees it too. But it's gone. They look towards the other end of the boat - and there's a beautiful mermaid, Tamara.] Scrum: Lord save me! [She stares intently]
Philip: [elbows some pirates] Men, look! Look there! [they gasp and look at Tamara. Ezekiel pulls a knife and she retreats] Scrum: You're scaring her off, mate! Ezekiel: Good riddance!
Scrum: [to Tamara] Can you talk?
Tamara: [drifts back to the boat] ...Yes.
[She puts her arms back on the edge, smiling. Scrum goes for a closer look.]
Scrum: You're beautiful.
Tamara: Are you the one who sings?
[as the camera pans underwater, revealing her tail]
Scrum: Aye.
Tamara: Are you my jolly sailor bold?
Scrum: Aye, that I be.
Someone: Scrum, comport yourself!
[They restrain him]
Scrum: Boys! There ain't much been given to me in my brief, miserable life, there's the truth of it. But, by God, I'll have it said that Scrum had himself a kiss from a PROPER MERMAID! [he gets free of the others]
Tamara: My heart is pierced by Cupid, I disdain all glittering gold, [Scrum moves his lips] there is nothing can console me but my jolly sailor bold! [as other mermaids drift underwater] Come all, ye pretty fair maids, whoever you may be, [they surface one by one, Philip notices] who love a jolly sailor bold, that ploughs the raging sea. [the other mermaids approach the boat] My heart is pierced by Cupid, I disdain all glittering gold. [mermaids are now at the edge, staring at each pirate] There is nothing can console me, but my jolly sailor bold. [camera pans underwater again, showing every tail.] My heart is pierced by Cupid, I disdain all glittering gold. [puts her arms around Scrum's face] There is nothing can console me, [Scrum gets ready for a kiss] but my jolly sailor bold. [She slowly takes his face underwater. Just then she reveals her teeth, which are now fangs. Just as she jumps and tries to bite him, Ezekiel jabs her away with an oar. Instantly all the other mermaids dive away, swim very quickly underwater, circling the longboat like sharks. The crew stand up, unsure what to do, then a mermaid leaps out of the water and grabs someone. They all get back to the longboat, trying to snatch everyone. One mermaid tries to grab Derrick, Philip comes to the rescue, pulling him out of the water. As the mermaid tries to get him again Philip kicks her away. Yet another mermaid leaps to the sky and Ezekiel stabs her with his sword and she lands back in the water.] [Back on shore] Blackbeard: Out upon it! It has begun! [Hands begin to reach through the longboat, creating massive holes. The pirates all try to stab them, but then everyone falls into the water. Other mermaids from the depths begin to swim towards their prey. A mermaid manages to grab Derrick and dives deep underwater with him, bites into his chest, lots of blood. Two other mermaids join in the kill. Ezekiel and Philip come towards the surface. Philip is suddenly dragged back underwater by ANOTHER mermaid. Philip tries to get back up.]
[On shore again.] Purser: [as he and another pirate throw gunpowder barrels into the water] Light 'em up! Muster your courage! Drive 'em to shore! [Lots of pirates throw many lighted barrels into the water. The barrels explode in frenzy, finally, Philip manages to get free of the mermaids and swims towards the surface.] [Back at the dock] Angelica: Nets into the water! Quickly!
[Some pirates bring out a huge net. Mermaids are already at the gunpowder barrel boats, tip them over as the pirates escape. Purser drops his barrel but is stuck in the boat as it flips over. The boat explodes upon impact, mermaids fleeing from it. Shot of Blackbeard's eyes as he watches the madness, rubs the sword's jewels. Soon the QAR arrives, shoots the Greek fire at the mermaids. The mermaids all swim towards the shoreline to escape the flames.] Blackbeard: A gold doubloon to the man who spots the first! Do not be greedy. We need but a single one! [It gets nastily quiet as the pirates hold the net. Just then something whips by in the darkness, a pirate gets dragged away. Soon more and more get tangled up in seaweed whips thrown by the mermaids.]
Jack: Retreat, all! To land! For your lives! [even more pirates taken] Retreat, I say!
Blackbeard: [shoves Jack aside] Cowards! Back in the water! There be no refuge on land - [takes out pistol] on my word! [shoots, one pirate narrowly misses the shot.] [Jack watches as a huge crowd of mermaids come swimming over. On the dock a seaweed whip latches onto one of the stakes. The pier collapses, Angelica and Jack fall down. Angelica tries to crawl away from the danger, reaching for Jack's hand. A seaweed whip latches onto her boot. She watches as a mermaid tries to pull her into the water. Jack immediately stands up and slashes away at the whip, cutting Angelica free. She looks up at him in shock as he extends his hand.] Jack: Come on! [Helps her to her feet; stares at the lighthouse. He runs along the bridge as mermaids attack it. A whip takes away his sword; jumps over an attacking mermaid. The mermaid hisses and snatches the air at him. Dodges more mermaids and trips, kicks a mermaid backwards, then continues onward. Meanwhile Philip and the others make it to nearby rocks. Philip lies down in exhaustion. Jack finally makes it to the lighthouse, glances around, grabs a large wooden stick and bangs away at the oil compartment. Philip looks around as Syrena's head appears half-out of the water. At the lighthouse, finally, oil leaks out, right onto the fire. Jack drops the stick and heads towards the window. Just as the lighthouse explodes, he jumps out and lands into the water below.]
[Philip squints at the bright light, tries to doge, but Syrena grabs his leg and pulls him out of the way. She swims away but gets trapped by some rubble.]
[Jack is seen underwater, watching the mermaids swimming away.]
[He surfaces, a mermaid is right in front of him. He spreads his arms in greeting.]
Jack: Marina. [smile falters] Please don't -
[Marina smacks him hard, then swims away, dives underwater. Jack has a dazed expression on his face.]
Picture
[Back on land, some pirates are dragging the net, something in it.] Salaman: We got one! [Blackbeard and Angelica come to investigate, but, it's Scrum.] Scrum: I'm in love! Blackbeard: [to all] Check the wounded! See if you can find one mermaid still alive! [Scrum collapses to the ground. Back to where Philip is; he sees Syrena's tail flipping around. He pulls the debris out of the way, and finally traps her by stabbing the end of her tail with his sword. She rises right out of the water and stares at him. The two look at each other; Syrena looking very scared. Philip releases the sword. Syrena continues staring, but just then a net is thrown over her head.] Blackbeard: Come, give a hand! [points at Philip] Well done, sailor.
[Philip stares, but doesn't do anything.] [Jack appears, soaking wet.] Jack: Did everyone see that? Because I will NOT be doin' it again! Blackbeard: Back to the ship. We head for a protected cove. Now. [Angelica throws Jack his sword, having recovered it. Blackbeard sees that gesture, but moves on anyway.] [Scene ends as Syrena still hisses fiercely.] Lots of rain, thunder is heard. Destroyed lighthouse in the background. HMS Providence sits in the sea. Barbossa's peg leg pokes something squishy.] Groves: [fearfully] Lord. Is that... [picks up one of the fins] Gibbs: Mermaid. [to Barbossa] Give up this madness now. Barbossa: I cannot. Ever walk on the beach, look back, and see your footsteps in the sand? It's like that, except the footsteps lie before me. Gillette: FootSTEP. Actually. Groves: Whitecap Bay, sir. We must hasten! [Screaming is heard, and Gillette instantly turns his head around. The others look in the same way, and see that the Providence is pitching and being overrun by mermaids.] Barbossa: We travel by foot! Gibbs, I require a heading. Groves: Sir. The men! Barbossa: They be dead already.
Groves: [scornful] They don't sound dead. Barbossa: [cocks pistol at him] Oh, is that so? But I hear nothing but seagulls nesting. What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?
Groves: [slight glance back at the ship; reluctantly] Seagulls. Nesting. Nothing more. Barbossa: [to Gibbs] Heading, Gibbs? [But Gibbs is watching as the ship finally tips over and starts to sink.] Groves: My God. Barbossa: [pistol at Gibbs] Your head, or my heading, I'll have me one or the other, I don't care which. [Gibbs hesitates, then moves on.] Gillette: All hands - forward! [Everyone follows Gibbs, Barbossa limping along with his crutch.]
[The crew lug Syrena in her tank up a rocky cliff. Angelica leads Jack, who's blindfolded. Blackbeard stops at the very top, Jack runs into him. Takes off his blindfold.] Blackbeard: It's to you now, Sparrow. Jack: Was that really necessary? Blackbeard: Best you not know the exact whereabouts of my ship, I be a cautious man. Jack: So be I. [takes out compass] What I want first...[the arrow points towards the northwest] ...is Ponce de Leon's ship.
Picture
[Goes forward, wide shot of the crew going towards a jungle.]
[The crew wades through a swamp. Brief shot of Syrena in her underwater form revolving around.] Scrum: [lugging one of the tank's handles] Why is it we've got to bring her along?
Angelica: Because tears don't keep. We need them fresh. Jack: What was the Ritual again? Water from the Fountain, and a mermaid's tear...
Angelica: And two Silver Chalices. One cup with the tear, one without.
Jack: So one with the tear and water in both. Quite complicated, is it not? Angelica: Both get water. One gets the tear. The person who drinks the water with the tear gets all the years of life from the other. Jack: How many years? ...Ooh.
[A snake swims by, and Angelica grabs it and swings it around her neck like some sort of voodoo priestess.]
Angelica: (a la Tia Dalma) All the years that they have lived, and they could have lived... [aims the snake's head towards Jack's face] ...if fate had been kinder! [juts the snake's head right at Jack, who flinches back slightly. It hisses fiercely, then she tosses it away.]
Picture
[Philip washes his face and neck in a small stream, Jack sitting next to him. Behind the two is Syrena, in the glass tank.]
Jack: Clergyman. On the off chance that this does not go well for me, I would like it noted that here now that I am fully prepared to believe in whatever I must, so that I may be welcomed into that place where the goody-goodies get to go once they pop their clogs, savvy?
Philip: We have a word for that, Jack. You can convert.
Jack: I was thinking more of an as-needed basis.
[Philip turns around, sees Syrena. She's gasping for air. He stands up.] Philip: Quartermaster! Quartermaster: Aye.
Philip: She cannot breathe. Quartermaster: She has water. Philip: She needs air! [he runs his hand along the edge of the tank, but it's locked.] Open this. Quartermaster: She will escape.
Philip: You're killing her. Jack: I support the missionary's position. [The Quartermaster simply laughs, but Philip grabs his sword and sticks it through the crack, and opens the tank. Syrena takes in the air.]
Philip: ..See?
[The Quartermaster stares, then takes out the sword, but before the tank is fully closed, Philip shoves in the Bible in its place.] Blackbeard: Onward.
[Philip and Syrena stare at each other. She looks hopeful.]
Picture
[Jack swats some trees out of the way with a machete and comes to a steep cliff. A river below.] Jack: [to himself] Just as I thought. [to the others] Not this way! Angelica: [goes over to him, and they look at the broken bridge] This is the way, isn't it? Jack: 'Course it is, but we should go around to the east.
Angelica: That would take us out of the path of the Chalices. Jack: Then we circle back. Angelica: There is no time. Jack: You're the one who insisted on bringing a bloody mermaid! Angelica: Well, the mutiny didn't help. Jack: You walk like a girl. Angelica: You would know. Blackbeard: [pops in on their conversation] Someone must go. Angelica: [as he walks off-screen] You mean split up?
Jack: [as Angelica looks back at the river] You mean jump? This I cannot wait to see. [grins] Blackbeard: Sparrow will go. [Angelica looks at him and his smile fades right at that moment] Find the ship, retrieve the Chalices. Angelica: Sparrow? What makes you think he will come back? Jack: Yes. What makes you think he will come back? Angelica: [sideways glance] We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.
Jack: [interested look] She'll go. [Angelica hands her sword to Scrum, gets a running start, but Blackbeard stops her. Shoves her aside.] Blackbeard: [to Jack] How much farther to the Fountain? I'm running out of time. Jack: [looks at compass, then ahead] About a day's march north following that river, you get to a series of pools...then you're close. Blackbeard: [grabs the compass. Jack resists. Snatches it out of his hand.] You will go. [The Quartermaster points his sword at Jack]
Jack: I was sure it would come to this.
[Jack and Angelica exchange a look as they switch sides. Jack places the machete on a post. Looks down as if he's afraid of heights.]
Jack: You know that feeling you get, sometimes, when you're standing in a high place, sudden urge to jump? ...I never have it. [Blackbeard points his pistol at Jack's head] Blackbeard: I need those Chalices. Jack: [smugly] Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall. Blackbeard: You will go. You will return. Or I will kill...her. [pistol at Angelica, she hesitates]
Jack: You won't kill your own daughter! Blackbeard: Quartermaster. [hands pistol over] Get me six more pistols, remove the shot from all but two, but do not tell me WHICH two. [Shot of the pistols on a rock.] Blackbeard: You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.
Jack: Oh. [points at one of them] ...No....mm-mm. No... [Angelica looks impatient] ...Yes? [offers a small one] Blackbeard: [takes it] You're sure? Jack: 'Course I am.
[As Blackbeard points the pistol at Angelica, Philip grips his cross necklace. But the pistol just clicks. Blackbeard gestures as if to say "Well. Won'tcha look at that." then hands the pistol over to Gunner.] Blackbeard: ...Again. Jack: Please. They're not even loaded. [grabs one, and the crew behind them ducks. Fires it into the sky, and they cower. Jack and Angelica look shocked.] Blackbeard: [firmly] Again. Jack: If you're so keen on killing her, why don't you just let her jump? Angelica: What?! [Jack gives her a surprised look] Blackbeard: [to Jack] If you jump, and die...THEN she will have her chance. [gestures at the pistols] ...Again. [Jack smiles slightly, then sidles over to the Quartermaster.] Jack: Oi. If I jump [gestures like so] ...will I survive? Quartermaster: [to Angelica; extends his arm] The doll. [Angelica hands it to him. He starts muttering something and then tosses the doll over the cliff. Jack screams as it does so. A splashing is heard, and the Quartermaster turns around.] Jack: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! [shuts up instantly] Quartermaster: Yes. Now you will survive. Angelica: [throws hat to the ground in anger; Jack looks relieved] THIS IS NONSENSE! I'M GOING! [She marches over to the cliff, but Jack runs past her and jumps himself.] Jack: AAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! [He splashes into the river. Everyone goes over to look. He surfaces.] Jack: ...Wet! Wet again! [swims away] Quartermaster: [off-screen] We go on. Due north, to the Fountain. [The QAR crew move off. Blackbeard and Angelica stay behind for a moment.] Angelica: Well played, Father. You knew which guns were loaded, right? Blackbeard: Of course, my love. [puts the compass in her hand, walks off.]
[Barbossa and Gibbs travel through a jungle, duck under branches.] Barbossa: Be nice to have a map about now. Gibbs: Or a ship. Barbossa: Stop! [Gibbs does so. There's a frog on his vest.] Hold very still. Ye dare not let it touch your skin. [pulls on a glove. Groves hands him a pair of tongs. Gibbs casts a sideways glance at the frog. It stops croaking once the tongs grabs it. Groves produces a jar and Barbossa shoves the frog in it. Pops the lid back on. Gibbs gives him a look.] Barbossa: What? What be wrong with an older man havin' a hobby? [quick glance at the jar; to the crew] What are you stoppin' for, eh? Push on! Groves: Push on! Barbossa: You can sleep when you're dead! Push on! [He gets a magnifying glass and looks in the jar; voice like an evil plotter] Fortune continues to favor us...
[Jack runs very fast through the jungle, comes to a clearing. He trips and falls. He whacks a bush nonsensically with his sword, continues. Runs along a beach and comes to an enormous archway. The Santiago is perched on the very top.] Jack: The Santiago. Famously captained by Ponce de Leon. [looks behind himself] Oh. There's no one there. Right, then. [heads to the cliff]
[The glass tank falls over and breaks, Syrena falling out of it. Blackbeard and Angelica turn around and stare as Syrena's tail flips around a few times, then it magically turns into legs. Philip runs over. Syrena curls up as if she's cold. Philip takes off his shirt and vest.]
Quartermaster: We must not stop.
[Syrena gasps slightly as Philip drapes the shirt around her.]
Blackbeard: You will walk. [The two stare for a moment, then Philip helps her up. She gets one foot forward, but she stumbles and falls.] Syrena: I cannot. Blackbeard: Walk or die. [Angelica instantly glances at him]
[The Quartermaster pulls his sword at the back of Syrena's neck. Philip crouches down to her.] Philip: Put your arms around me. Syrena: I do not ask for help! Philip: But you need it. [Reluctantly, she does so. He lifts her up into his arms.] Philip: We are in a hurry, yes? Blackbeard: Do not fall behind. [Later they come upon some trees and stop.] Angelica: Hold here 'til I say!
[Philip sets down Syrena on a root and looks at her] Philip: Such beauty. Surely you are one of God's own creations and not a descendant of those dark creatures who found no refuge on the Ark. Such beauty. Yet deadly. [he gets up to walk off]
Syrena: Deadly. No.
Philip: [turns around] You attacked me.
Syrena: No...you are different.
Philip: Different?
Syrena: Are you not? You protect.
Philip: ...You pushed me down out of the way.
[Syrena says nothing. Blackbeard appears.] Angelica: You see the Fountain? Blackbeard: No, but we are close. [gesturing to Syrena with his hat] Bring the creature, cover its head! Philip: [angrily] SHE HAS A NAME!!
[Syrena looks up immediately and Angelica turns around.]
Blackbeard: [spreads his arms] Pray tell.
[Syrena is staring at Philip with wide eyes]
Philip: She is Syrena.
Picture
[Wide shot as Jack climbs, and the Santiago is now very close. He appears in its cabin. Spots the skeleton in the bed.] Jack: Ponce de Leon. Barbossa: [off-screen] If forty pirates dreamt forty nights of treasure, it would not match the contents of this room. Jack: You. Barbossa: [appears out of the shadows] You. Jack: No...[takes out sword] You. Barbossa: I was here first. You. Why are you here? Jack: Blackbeard sent me. Why you? Barbossa: Silver Chalices from a royal liege. Jack: Oh, please. [Steps forward, clashes swords once, but the ship starts to tilt.] Barbossa: Back, back! We have to balance it out! The whole ship will slide! [Everything goes still] Jack: Right, then. [sheathes sword] What if...we each choose an item of approximately equal weight? [He picks up a vase, but then the ship tilts the other way] Barbossa: Put it back! We touch...NOTHING! [They go back the other way, Jack slams down the vase, but just then a chest slides out from under the bed. Two Chalices are on its lid.] Jack: But what about that? Barbossa: The Chalices. [He steps backwards, the chest goes towards him] Jack: Oi! Why do you get to look first? Barbossa: Fine, then! [They switch sides. Jack stops the chest with his foot, looks very happy. Barbossa trips over something and the ship lurches violently. Jack rolls down against a wall with Barbossa, the chest and several treasures rolling towards them. Kicks the chest and crawls towards it, Barbossa following. They put their hands on it at the same time.] Barbossa and Jack: Together. [They open it.] Jack: ...Rocks. Barbossa: The Spanish. Jack: They're ahead of us, mate. [looks at the skeleton] I shall have a look at that map, if it's what I fear... [The two get down on either side of it, Jack makes a disgruntled sound and tosses away a coin. Barbossa stares at the map as Jack takes it.] Jack: Wonder why they left this behind. [Ponce turns his head, and Jack stares at it back, smile fading. Barbossa mouths "Don't touch the map."] Jack: Oh. [drops it] Barbossa: They know the path. But I can also see where they'll most likely make camp. [Zoom in on the map, revealing the San Miguel fort.]
[The placemarks on the map turn into an actual camp. Jack and Barbossa stare at it. Gibbs comes up from behind.] Gibbs: Jack! Barbossa: Shh! [gestures for Gibbs to come on anyway.] Jack: Gibbs. I was just on me way to break you out of jail. Gibbs: Hmmm. Jack: You stole my map. [flicks him on the nose] Barbossa: Right. Best be started. Jack: [As Barbossa and Gibbs leave] Olé.
Picture
[The QAR crew make their way through Jungle Pools. Blackbeard lowers a torch at a mermaid skeleton.] Blackbeard: Mermaids. [Gunner lowers Syrena into one of the pools] Blackbeard: Careful, these pools run deep. If she escapes, all is lost. Quartermaster! [The Quartermaster rips off the hood covering her head, and she hisses] Blackbeard: Look. LOOK! [view of a skeleton in front of Syrena] Staked out to die, to dry in the sun. Only half in the water, not enough to live, but just enough to make the dying slow. Think on it, your people, murdered, harvested for their tears. Syrena. Won't you cry? Syrena: [sternly] All die. Even you. Soon, I hear. Blackbeard: [ignoring her] Listen. [grabs the scruff of her neck] LISTEN. Can you not hear your sisters scream? Do you not hear them? We need but one tear. [smacks her] VILE CREATURE! [Master-of-Arms grabs hold of Philip] Ezekiel: Chop off her fingers! One by one! Garheng: Choke her! Salaman: Cut out the tears. From behind the eyes. [Philip gets free of Master-at-Arms, faces Angelica] Philip: Where is your voice in this? Angelica: [to Blackbeard] Maybe she will have a change of heart, when the sun rises. Blackbeard: Aye. She will burn, but I cannot wait for the sun. Perhaps we should build a fire. Philip: No. Blackbeard: [shoves him away] Do not contest me, cleric. Philip: You will not torture her! Angelica: We need only one tear. Blackbeard: I will tear every scale from her body one by one if I see fit, if that displeases you, [waves hand] go pray. Philip: I was wrong. Not every soul can be saved. Yours cannot. Blackbeard: Behold, gentlemen! A man formerly of faith. Philip: That vile creature as you call her is worth a hundred of you. Blackbeard: So you care for her...you fancy her. [an accusing finger at him] Do not deny what is clear to my eyes. [goes to Syrena, who looks down] Question is...does she fancy you? By God, she does! We are in luck! Bring forth a tear... [Quartermaster pulls a knife and hands it to him] ...or witness the death of this poor soul. [The Quartermaster grabs Philip. Scrum is now holding a vial to Syrena's eye, and tries to resist] Philip: [desperately] Syrena! If you could manage a tear, I would be grateful. [Syrena simply stares with no emotion] Blackbeard: Sadness, yes. But no sorrow...YET. [a glance at the Quartermaster] [Angelica leaps up] Angelica: Not by your hand, Father -- Blackbeard: Time and tide waits for none! Quartermaster. [hands the knife over] [Immediately he slits Philip's throat (seemingly). Syrena looks away, unable to contain the horrible sight. Shot of Philip's body just lying there. Scrum and Salaman have no expression. Syrena looks like she's about to cry, but doesn't.] Blackbeard: My, mermaids are tough, the lot of them. Tie her up, like the others. [kicks Philip's body] Mm...get rid of this. [Yeoman and Master-at-Arms drag him away as he approaches Angelica.] Blackbeard: You are confident. Angelica: Yes. I am a woman. So is she. [walks away] [Yeoman and Master-at-Arms toss Philip into a ravine.]
Picture
[Gibbs, Jack, and some of the HMS Providence crew make their way through bamboo jungles.] Gibbs: What's your play, Jack? Throwing in with Barbossa. Jack: There is a girl. A female. Of the opposite sex. Gibbs: When is there not? Jack: Perhaps I should say - a damsel. Gibbs: [in amazement] You're rescuing a damsel? Well, there's a first. Jack: Yes, but it's just that I may have caused said damsel some matter of harm many moons ago. Gibbs: Out with it. Jack: Gibbs. This is the woman from Seville. [They stop] Gibbs: Ah. You pretended to love her then you left her and broke her heart. Jack: Worse. I may have had, briefly, mind you...stirrings. Gibbs: Stirrings? Jack: Stirrings. Gibbs: What, like...feelings, you mean? Jack: No, no, no, no, not quite all the way to feelings. More like...[Gibbs gives him a look]...all right, feelings, damn you. Gibbs: [as Jack moves forward but he stops] And you left her still. Oh, that's low. Jack: ...Thank you.
[The group comes upon a Spanish Camp.] Barbossa: [motions to them] Hsst! [Jack approaches him] Jack: Stealth over force, I'll take it from here on account of your condition. You don't have termites, do you? Barbossa: I appreciate your concern, Jack, but I'll be keepin' you company, all the same. [to Lt. Groves] Hold here, Lieutenant Commander. Wait for my signal. [Groves watches them head towards the camp. Shot of the duo wading through the lake. Carefully they peek out one by one behind columns. Then they move forward, Barbossa's peg leg making a loud clomping sound. Peek through small trees. The Spanish Officer is sitting at a table, talking with some other soldiers. The Spaniard comes out of a tent.] Barbossa: There, that one. That be the leader. Make note of his tent, because that's where -- [shot of the two Chalices] Oh wait, by God! That must be them right there! [The two drop down onto their hands and knees.] Jack: [sniffs] Your sword...smells...funny. Barbossa: Aye. Poison. From the innards of poisonous toads. Just a scratch, and you're a dead man in minutes. Jack: Would you mind pointing it another way? [a whisper] I don't like toads. [They stand up] Jack: What are you doing? Barbossa: Planning an escape route. Isn't that how you do it? Jack: ...Yes. Well, sometimes I just...improvise. [runs off-screen] [Shot of one Chalice, revealing "Aqua" on its edge. Jack's eyes appear behind the table, he snatches the other Chalice. The Spanish Officer turns around and sees it's gone, but Barbossa's crutch takes away the other. He looks under the table, but there's nothing there. Gets whacked on the back of the head by Barbossa.] Barbossa: Now what? [tosses a Chalice to Jack] Jack: We stroll out, slow and steady. Just like we belong. [As they walk out of the camp, Jack does his signature salute to a passing soldier. But he turns around, and they begin to fight - soon lots of them join in. At one point Barbossa spits on one of them. Jack and Barbossa sheathe their swords and run for it, but they run into lots of soldiers.]
[Philip wakes up, and pulls a dart out of his chest.] [He runs over to Syrena and unties the rope binding her] Philip: I'm sorry, Syrena. Syrena: Philip, you're alive. Philip: Yes. Syrena: You came for me. [a whisper] Why? Philip: You are different, are you not? Do you know not of kindness? Compassion? [Syrena stares intently, she smiles...but then tears come to her eyes. The crew immediately runs over. The Quartermaster restrains Philip. Some others grab Syrena, Scrum holds the vial to her cheek, capturing the tear. He hands it to Angelica.] Blackbeard: Tears of sorrow, never. Mermaids be too tough for that. [takes the vial] Tears of joy...they say these be the more potent, anyway. Philip: Syrena, on my word, I had no part in this! [to Blackbeard] Let her go. You don't need her now. Blackbeard: Let her go? No. Secure her bonds. We leave her with her own. [Syrena and Philip exchange last looks before he is forced away.]
Picture
Jack: How's that escape route workin'? Barbossa: Here's your chance to improvise. Jack: I'm attempting it. [as Barbossa unscrews his peg leg] I might be able to get a hand loose. Oh, you've got a knife! That's very good. Barbossa: [pulls out the cork with his mouth] Better. [He starts drinking from the leg] Jack: ...I want one of those. [Barbossa hands the leg carefully over] Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear. Barbossa: [as Jack sips from the leg] Revenge? Jack: Come come, Hector. If you wanted the Chalices, you'd seen they were missing and gone. You were lying in wait. For Blackbeard. Barbossa: [curious, surprised look] Oh? Jack: [hands the leg back] King George, privateer. Wig. Cheap theatrical facade. Not buying it. Barbossa: [rather mysteriously] You weren't there that night. Jack: When the Pearl was lost. Barbossa: Taken. Not lost. We were off the coast of Hispaniola when we came under attack. No provocation nor warning nor offer of parley. We were peppered with cannonfire. And then the sea beneath the Pearl began to roil. The Pearl was pitching and yawing violently. Every plank, every rail, every spar all at once began to creak! The rigging had come to life! Our own ship turned against us! Tangling the crew, wrapping around them like snakes! And wrapping around my leg -- [glances quickly at his leg] But me arms were free and my sword was at hand. I am the master of my ship, not Blackbeard. I am the master of my fate, NOT Blackbeard! So I did what needed done. [takes a long drink, then a triumphant sort of look] I survived. Jack: [as Barbossa reattaches his leg] So. You're not after the Fountain? Barbossa: I care not for King George or tavern yarns that give hope for a healed limb. But I'd give my left arm for a chance at Blackbeard. Jack: Not your right? Barbossa: I need me good arm to drive my poisoned blade through his...heart. Jack: [his hands are now free, he rubs them] I'll see you get the chance, mate. [he wiggles his fingers]
[Jack climbs upwards a palm tree, still tied by the waist. He disappears off-screen. Barbossa looks around his tree, keeping watch. Several guards wander around the camp. Barbossa watches as Jack reaches the top. The tree sways side to side, and he unties himself, ties the rope to a coconut. He swings it around and around like a cowboy, then the coconut latches onto a faraway tree. Using all his strength, Jack pulls it towards him. The Spanish see what's going on.] Guy: The prisoner is escaping. [Finally, Jack lets go of the rope, and catapults into the air. He lands onto another tree.] Guy: HE'S ESCAPING! Fan out! Find him! [All the guards take their swords and spread out.] Guy: Hold your fire! I want him alive! [Meanwhile, Groves appears (albeit without his wig) in front of Barbossa.] Groves: I figured that was the signal. [Gives him his effects and cuts the ropes.] [The Spanish guards reach another tree, and suddenly coconuts pelt them. Some get knocked out. Jack appears, and swings like Tarzan, hitting several soldiers. Drops down; as he runs, he trips them, and wounds them around and around a tree. Disappears. Shot of Barbossa, Groves, and the crew making their escape. Groves: Go! Prepare to move out! Barbossa: The enemy is soon upon us! I'm sorry about the Chalices, Jack, but I've an appointment to keep. I'll not be going back. Jack: No need. [produces the Chalices] Shall we have a drink? Barbossa: We'll drink at the Fountain! [They all leave, and Gibbs grabs Jack by his shirt collar.]
Picture
[Angelica holds Jack's compass and makes her way through a jungle - suddenly Jack's sword appears at her neck.] Angelica: How is it we can never meet without you pointing something at me? [Jack smiles.] Blackbeard: You brought the Chalices, Sparrow! Jack: Aye. Oi! [He gestures towards a bush, and Gibbs appears with a pig. The Chalices are tied to it.] Angelica: I see you brought a friend. Jack: I did. Blackbeard: And the one-legged man, he is near...aye? Jack: Aye. Now, before I just go handing them over, I do have one or two conditions. Blackbeard: Name them. Jack: Firstly...I'll be having the compass back. No, no, no, that's secondly. Firstly, on your word...you will bring no harm to Angelica. [she looks on] Blackbeard: I'll make no vow to the likes of you, Sparrow. [puts a hand on her shoulder] But it cost me nothing to admit that she was never in harm's way. Jack: ..Secondly, then, priorly firstly. I will be having the compass back. [Angelica glances at Blackbeard] Please. I do deserve it. [Blackbeard is stroking Angelica's hand with his thumb] Do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch that filthy pig? Not the...big one. The four-legged one. [Angelica tosses him the compass] Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard, [he looks bored, uninterested] there are times - not very often - when I do reflect on my heinous misdeeds. Chief among them, and note how poorly I treated Mr. Gibbs, my loyal First Mate. Gibbs: Aye, now you bring it up -- Jack: Left him to rot in jail, I did. Didn't care. Still don't. But, point being, you must let him go free. Blackbeard: ...Is that it? Jack: ...I think so. [gestures at the pig] Quick, or the pig runs. And good luck getting those Chalices. Gibbs: Jack, if it's all same to you, I'd be just as -- Blackbeard: DONE. Jack: Release the swine. [As the pig tries to scurry away, Gibbs nimbly grabs the Chalices one by one. Jack simply smiles, and Blackbeard does not return it. Gibbs: [holding the Chalices] Perhaps you don't mind if I tag along with you folk for a -- [Blackbeard walks forward, snatches the Chalices, continues on with the crew.] Jack: [tosses Gibbs the compass] This will lead you to freedom, mate. [Gibbs is left alone.]
Picture
[A giant leaf is pushed aside and Jack appears.] Jack: I could've swore it was somewhere right around here. [More leaves, and this time just his face is in view. He looks side to side, then spots a water droplet defying gravity. Jack watches it as it travels upwards, then takes it with his finger. It goes from finger to finger as he plays with it. He squints through it, moving his hand here and there across a rock wall in front of him. The camera goes very close on the droplet, revealing the same symbol that was in the Logbook and the Mao Kun map (the navigational charts). Finally the droplet breaks free of his finger's grip and it floats upwards, Jack's eyes following its path. The full carving is revealed, panning down to a cave entrance. A bird flies into it. Jack smiles. Later, a torch is seen lighted. The Quartermaster holds it, leading Jack, Angelica, etc., into the cavern. Deep inside the cave there are stalagmites and stalactites. Salaman breaks a piece off - and a stalactite falls onto a pirate's shoulder, killing him instantly. Everyone stares.] Quartermaster: [off-screen] We must not stop. [They all move on, a pirate puts the dead one's hat back on.]
Picture
[Much deeper inside, the Quartermaster waves the torch across a wall - but there's nothing there.] Jack: Aha! Dead end! Blackbeard: Dead. End? Jack: Dead end! [Music stops, creating slight silence.] Angelica: Jack. I'm starting to think you don't know where you're going. Jack: It is not the destination so much as the journey, they say. Chalices, if you please. [Blackbeard nods to the Quartermaster, who hands them reluctantly to Jack. Jack raises them high in the air, one in each hand.] Jack: Stand back. [Confused, everyone does as he says. Music swells suspensefully, then -- DINGGGGG! Everyone exchanges looks. DINGGGGGGGGGGG!] Angelica: [clears throat] Jack, have you ever, in fact, seen with your own eyes, the Fountain of Youth? Jack: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question, please? Blackbeard: Quartermaster... Jack: [as he pulls a pistol on him] No, no! [shields himself with the Chalices, the bullet ricochets off them. Blackbeard cocks his pistol.] No, wait, wait! Wait. [The Chalices are very close to his face. Now we can see the words carved on the cups.] Aqua...de Vida. [A rumbling is heard. The Cabin Boy and the others look down as water flows across the floor. The water rises along the walls, collecting into a pool above their heads. They duck slightly as the bird flies right through it. Jack grins.] Jack: Master Scrum. Do you mind? Scrum: Squire? [Hands him the Chalices and makes a gesture with his arm. Scrum gingerly lifts him up. Jack brandishes his sword and pokes the pool - and the sword disappears. Immediately he gets sucked into it too] [Jack floats upwards, arm still extended, in some sort of dreamlike place. Carefully steps forward, picks up his sword, and the camera reveals THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. An archway with water pouring out of its middle. Lighted by beautiful sunlight coming from above the trees surrounding it. Jack continues forward as Angelica and the rest appear. Blackbeard glances at his hands, then looks around.] Angelica: So beautiful. [Very slowly they approach the Fountain. There are lots of skeletons surrounding it. Jack races up the steps. He reaches out to poke the stream of water.] Blackbeard: Sparrow, I'll be the first to taste those waters.
Picture
Angelica: [sees something behind him] Father. Blackbeard: [without looking] The one-legged man. [The Quartermaster nods slowly. Angelica faces Jack.] Angelica: You brought him here. Jack: Would I do that? Barbossa: Edward Teach! [everyone watches as he and his crew appear through the fog] For crimes committed on the high seas, by the authority granted to me by His Majesty the King, with a goodly amount of personal satisfaction, I hereby place you in the custody of the court, and declare you to be my prisoner. Blackbeard: [going over to him] My trick's out, is that it? Barbossa: Such crimes do include but are not limited to: piracy, treason, murder, torture of the most heinous sort, including the brutal theft of one used, twisted, hairy right leg! [brandishes sword] Blackbeard: [takes out his sword] You...dare face this sword? Barbossa: This far away from your ship? Aye. Blackbeard: Aye. That be the cold breath of Fate I feel down my nape. But - I'll have one last fight, by God! KILL THEM ALL! [Just as everyone takes out their weapons and begin to fight, Jack bursts in.] Jack: Whoah, whoah, hang on a minute! [awkward silence] I just...I just need to understand something. Right, so. [gestures from Barbossa to Blackbeard] You will fight against them, [vice versa] they will fight against you all on account of him [Barbossa to Blackbeard again] wanting to kill him? Where is the sense? [Scrum shrugs] Exactly. I say, let them fight each other! While we lay back, watch, and have a drink, place some wages! Eh?!? Scrum: ...Aye. [puts away his sword] [Building tension] Barbossa: KILL THEM! Blackbeard: NO QUARTER! [Jack shields himself and Barbossa and Blackbeard clash swords. Everything goes absolutely crazy as both crews battle. Blackbeard slashes right at Barbossa, who blocks it with both his sword and crutch. Tries to stab Blackbeard's head but he dodges. Blackbeard punches him in the face just as Yeoman tosses Gillette aside, gets in the way of Blackbeard's downward slash. He gets stabbed right in the back, dies instantly, flopping onto Barbossa.] Barbossa: Get it off me! [tosses his body aside, leaving it lying there] [Meanwhile the Quartermaster stabs someone right through, leaving a bloody gash. Philip immediately tuns over and tries to cut his bonds on the guy's sword. Instead the Cabin Boy runs over, cuts it off with his knife. The two stare for a moment, then the Cabin Boy runs off. Philip gets up and makes his escape, but is stabbed through the stomach by a Providence crew member. He clutches his wound and staggers away from the battle, disappearing among the vines and whatnot.] [Angelica battles another Providence sailor] Angelica: Scrum, the Chalices! [he throws a sack] And the tear! Follow! [She scurries, Scrum bumps into someone and stumbles. Gets back up and Jack is there, stopping him, sword at his neck.] Jack: Hand it over. The tear. There's a good lad. Scrum: I'm more afraid of her than I am of you. [They fight for a few moments, he sticks the tear's pouch into his mouth, then Jack kicks him in the stomach. Scrum spits out the pouch. Jack grabs it but he is stopped by Angelica, sword at HIS neck.] Angelica: Hand it over. There's a good lad. [Scrum has his sword at Jack too.] Jack: ...The Chalices, if you please. Angelica: Ha! Sorry, Jack. I told you. I need years. And now, yours will do. [He tosses the pouch, Angelica jumps up to grab it, causing Scrum to toss his sword. He points both this sword and his sword at each of them] Jack: Haha! [Another toss of the swords] Angelica: SCRUM! [Jack grabs the pouch, grins, then kicks the bag Scrum's holding and the Chalices fall out. He and Angelica stare at each other, then go over to them, while Scrum looks through the Fountain's arch.] [At the Jungle Pools, Philip races through the trees. He trips slightly and finds Syrena, still tied up.] Philip: Syrena. [touches her face] My God. You will not take her back. If you have taken her, [unties the ropes] give - her - back. Give her back...[rubs her cheek with his thumb] Give her back...please...please... [Syrena opens her eyes and stares a moment, then disappears into the water. Philip drops down as if he is trying to chase after her, but watches as she disappears into the tunnel.] [Back at the Fountain of Youth, Barbossa and Blackbeard are still fighting. Barbossa uses his crutch to do another blocking move, but Blackbeard slashes it away.] Blackbeard: [waving his sword threateningly] Ha! I expected Fate to put up more of a fight, eh? [Barbossa punches him in the face, they repeatedly attempt stabbing motions at each other. Finally Blackbeard trips his peg leg, making him fall into the shallow puddles.] Blackbeard: [approaching him] I will not have that smile on your face as I strike you down! [They lock swords] Barbossa: Take a gander, Edward Teach. [Blackbeard slowly turns around to see what he's talking about - the Spaniard and his men have arrived. Jack and Angelica emerge from the struggle with the Chalices, Jack holding them. Blackbeard turns completely around to see soldiers appearing from above from ledges. Groves appears in front of the Fountain, drops his sword, and unfurls the British flag.] Groves: This land is hereby forever claimed from the glorious name of His Majesty, King George - [A gunshot fires out, piercing through the flag and killing Groves instantly. Groves falls to the ground and the flag drapes over him where he rests. Blackbeard immediately looks at the source of the gunshot] Spaniard: [lowers pistol, hands it to one of his men] Someone make a note of that man's bravery. [he sees the Chalices in Jack's hands, but Jack simply gives them to Angelica and walks away] Señorita, the Chalices, por favor. [She doesn't give them to him, instead, she is shoved down. The Spaniard takes the Chalices and looks at them. He steps onto a platform.] Spaniard: Only God can grant eternal life. Not this pagan water. [He drops the Chalices and stomps on them. Jack and Angelica watch as he tosses them into a deep pool. Blackbeard stares.] Spaniard: Men! Destroy this profane temple. [Immediately, his men grab weapons and start to pull down the columns] Quartermaster: The Fountain! [he and Gunner move off-screen as the Spaniard and Blackbeard approach each other] Spaniard: [points sword at Blackbeard] You are a fool. You seek in this place what only faith can provide. [In the background, British soldiers drag Groves' and Gillette's bodies away.] Blackbeard: [as Barbossa appears behind him] Faith. In faith there is light enough to see but darkness enough to blind. [Just then, Barbossa slashes his wrist, leaving a bloody deep cut. Blackbeard drops the sword and looks at his hand.] Blackbeard: What devilry is this? [He spins around but Barbossa stabs him straight in the (lower left part) stomach. Pushes in the sword a bit deeper.] Barbossa: For the Pearl. Angelica: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE???!!!!??? [Barbossa drops him, and Angelica immediately runs over. She grabs the sword's blade.] Jack: ANGELICA! DON'T! IT'S POISON!!!! [Angelica pulls out the sword but her palm is cut. She slowly looks up at him fearfully] Barbossa: I'm not such the fool to take on Blackbeard without a little...venomous advantage. Angelica: [looks at Jack, worriedly] Jack... [He hesitates, then turns around. Meanwhile the Spanish are still pulling down columns. Jack drops down into the pool where the Spaniard tossed the Chalices and tries to find them. Barbossa picks up Blackbeard's sword.] Barbossa: [loudly] I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew, and this sword...payment for me missing limb. [The QAR crew leaves with him. Angelica desperately tries to help Blackbeard. Jack looks for the cups in another pool, but nothing. The Spanish struggle with another column as Gunner and Quartermaster fend off a couple of soldiers. Just then, the column is tipped over - Jack watches as the two zombies get crushed, including the Fountain's arch.] [The Spaniard makes the sign of the cross, then he and his men leave.] Spaniard: Vámonos! (Let's go!)
Picture
[Jack glances around as everything gets quiet. Just then Syrena appears from the pool, holding the two Chalices. He stares in disbelief, taking them.] Syrena: Do not waste my tear. [She disappears, then Jack jumps up. Angelica and Blackbeard are suffering from the effects of the poison as Jack manages to find a few trickles of the Fountain waters. He manages to get a few drops in each one before it runs dry. He opens the vial and plops the tear in one of the cups. He gets to Angelica and Blackbeard. His voice catches their attention.] Jack: [offering the left Chalice] Drink this. This one has the tear. [to Blackbeard] You must drink the other. Angelica: No. Jack: I cannot save you both. One of you must sacrifice. Angelica: [a weak whisper] You take it, Father...for your soul. [Blackbeard glances at Jack] Jack: Captain Teach. She's dying. You must save your daughter. [offers the Chalice] Blackbeard: This one takes life. [points at the other] This one has the tear and gives life. Jack: Aye. Hurry. [Blackbeard snatches the left Chalice and drinks it. She looks sadly at him] Blackbeard: Angelica...[gestures at the other] ...save me, my child. Jack: [as she takes it and drinks] No. [She whines slightly.] Blackbeard: Oh...
Angelica: [whisper] I love you, Father.
[Jack stands up to move away as the other two get up. He stops in his tracks.
Jack: Wait a minute. [realizing] In fact, it might've been the other way around. [Blackbeard looks] This cup had the tear. That one had the..other bit.
Blackbeard: TRICKSTER! DEVIL! [takes a step]
Angelica: Father! [Blackbeard looks down. There's fogs and water surrounding his feet. Angelica looks at her palm, and the cut is healing. She glares angrily at Jack.]
Angelica: YOU BASTARD!!! HOW COULD YOU???!!!!??
Jack: Your father saved you. Perhaps his soul is now redeemed. Eh?
[Angelica looks devastated. Just then the powerful waters of the Fountain rush towards them. Blackbeard stares a moment and almost immediately it completely surrounds him. Jack watches as Blackbeard's skin gets ripped off. Angelica looks horrified as Blackbeard's rotting skeletal arm reaches out to her. The waters finally clear away as the skeleton collapses, leaving nothing.]
[Philip is dragging himself to one of the pools, and drinks several gulps of water. Just then Syrena appears. They look at each other.
Syrena: You are hurt.
Philip: In body only. My mind is at peace. Because of you.
Syrena: Me?
Philip: Yes. I was lost. The winds, the tides...they ought to renew a man's faith. For me, only you.
Syrena: We say the One pours death into life, and life into death, without a drop spilt.
Philip: I like that.
Syrena: Philip, I can save you. You need only ask.
Philip: I seek but one thing.
Syrena: What is that?
Philip: Forgiveness. If not for me, you'd have never been captured.
Syrena: Ask.
Philip: Forgive me.
[Syrena drifts upwards and kisses him, and she puts her arms around him. She drags him underwater, and the two disappear.]

[Jack and Angelica are in a longboat, Angelica's hands are tied together.] Angelica: I hate you.
Jack: The bloke who saved your life.
Angelica: The years I possess - STOLEN from my own father! Jack: I only helped Blackbeard do what any father should have done. Angelica: You are cruel. And ignorant. [Angelica is dumped onto the sand, Jack throws a pistol after her.] Jack: One pistol. One shot. Angelica: To kill myself before I starve?!? Jack: There's no trusting you, love. Besides, this is a well-traveled trade route! You can signal a passing ship. Or, you can just bite the proverbial bullet, as it were. Angelica: AND HOW WILL I GET GET FREE OF THESE BONDS? Jack: [walks away] You broke free of your bonds half an hour ago, waiting for the precise moment to pounce. [He instantly swings around before Angelica can whack him with a piece of driftwood. He grabs it and tosses it away.] Angelica: Admit it, Jack. You still love me. Jack: If you had a sister and a dog...I'd choose the dog. [continues onward] Angelica: Treasure! There is a chest with jewels! Jewels with the power to rule the wind and tide! Jack: You're making that up. [Angelica grabs his back, he turns around.] Angelica: Wait. I am with child. Yours. Jack: [stares a moment] I don't recall that we ever had -- Angelica: You were drunk! Jack: I've actually never been that drunk. [still goes on] Angelica: Wait. [grabs his arm this time] There's something I want to say to you. Something I wanted to say from the moment we first met. Jack: [like he doesn't care] Go on, then. Angelica: I love you. Jack: [touches her chin] As do I. Always have, always will. [they lean in VERY close to a kiss...but just then the music stops dramatically.] I gotta go. [he turns quickly away, and tumbles into the longboat] Angelica: JACK! THIS IS NOT OVER! JACK!!!!!!! [she races off-screen] [Jack is now rowing far, water splashes up behind him - a gunshot.] Jack: Missed! [wide shot of Sola Fide Beach, camera pans out as Angelica yells] Angelica: SPARROW! Eres malo! Malo como el demonio! (Sparrow! You're bad/evil! Bad/evil as the devil/hell!)
[Barbossa's peg leg appears, and the camera pans up to find him looking at the QAR.] Barbossa: The Revenge...is mine. [Now he is shown in his pirate garb (yay!) at the helm. But without his hat. The Cabin Boy appears.] Cabin Boy: Sir. [Barbossa turns around - and he's holding his beloved hat.] I found this, belowdecks. [Barbossa takes it and holds it for a moment...then flips it onto his head. He pulls out Blackbeard's sword, and the rigging starts to move. Ropes unwind and the sails unfurl. Then he points it towards the bow, and the pirates fall over as the QAR goes full speed. Finally he sheathes it as if nothing happened.] Barbossa: All hands! Ply to windward! GET CRACKIN', YE BLOOMIN' COCKROACHES! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! [pulls out his old papers] The Crown served me well! But now, by the Gods of sea and sky! MAKE WAY, FOR TORTUGA!!!!!!!!!!!!! [rips up the papers and throws them to the wind as everyone cheers. Scrum plays a tune on his mandola.]
Picture
[Jack steps out from a longboat and sees Gibbs sitting on a pile of driftwood] Jack: Gibbs, you filthy besotted shellback, you made it! Gibbs: Aye! Jack: And I trust we managed to profit from our joint enterprise? Gibbs: Feast your eyes. [gestures towards the Black Pearl in the bottle] [Jack bends down to look at it, and Gibbs joins] Gibbs: The compass led me straight and true. Jack: What of Blackbeard's men, guarding the ship? Gibbs: I employed the selfsame maneuver we perfected in New Guinea. Jack: Oh. Gibbs: Seemed a shame to leave an entire fleet behind. [raises the bag full of bottles] Jack: [looks at him] Shame indeed. [Jack picks up the bottle, and faces the horizon. We can perfectly see the Black Pearl and Jack takes a closer peek. Cotton's parrot squawks - but Jack the Monkey appears swinging on a rope. Jack flinches back.] Jack: I hate that monkey!
Gibbs: So the Pearl. Any idea how to get her out?
Jack: [lowers bottle] We shall need a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats, one of us must learn to play the trumpet while the other one goes like this. [waves fingers]
Gibbs: I know a man with a goat! Jack: Good! I can go like this. [waves fingers] [Later, they are walking along the shore]
Gibbs: Jack, I have to ask. You had the Chalices, the water, the tear...you could've lived... maybe forever.
Jack: The Fountain does test you, Gibbs. But better to not know which moment may be your last, every morsel of your entire being alive to the infinite mystery of it all. And who's to say I won't live forever, eh? Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth. I have no say in it, Gibbs...it's a pirate's life for me. Savvy?
